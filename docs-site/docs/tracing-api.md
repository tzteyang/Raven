# Tracing and Instrumentation API { #tracing-api }

To inspect a failed task, export a reviewed report, or create a replay-based
regression, start with [Trajectory debugging and replay](trajectory-debugging.md).
This page is the instrumentation contract.

The contract between **raven** (and any other adopter) and the in-tree
`raven.tracing` implementation. `raven-tracing` is the planned standalone
distribution, not a separate dependency of the current Raven package.

Principle: *tracing owns the standard, the app adopts it.* `raven.tracing` defines
what a span is, which fields each span kind carries, and how it renders. An app
(raven) instruments itself by calling one small, stable facade — `trace.span(...)`
— at points it chooses. Neither side depends on the other's internals; the only
coupling is this API's version + the semantic conventions below.

This mirrors the OpenTelemetry model (library defines the API + data model; the
app does manual instrumentation), so the same discipline applies: the API is
tiny and slow-moving, the SDK behind it (storage, viewer, on-disk format) iterates
freely without touching adopters.

Related: the on-disk record shape (`audit.span.v1`) is defined in
`raven/tracing/spans.py` (`build_span`) and summarized in §2; this document is
the **write-side** standard that produces those records.

## 1. Public API

One import, one primary call:

```python
from raven.tracing import trace

with trace.span("llm.call", {"llm.provider": provider, "llm.model": model}) as s:
    resp = do_call(...)
    s.set({"llm.usage.total_tokens": resp.usage.total, "llm.finish_reason": resp.finish_reason})
```

### `trace.span(name, attributes=None, *, kind=None, **kw) -> Span`

A context manager that opens a span on enter and finalizes + records it on exit.

- `name` — dotted semantic name, `<domain>.<verb>` (e.g. `llm.call`). Drives the
  default `kind` and the viewer's label/rendering (see §2).
- `attributes` — a mapping of fully-qualified dotted keys (the standard form,
  e.g. `{"llm.provider": p, "llm.model": m}`). Standard keys are dotted, so a
  mapping is the primary form; `**kw` accepts bare keys for convenience (stored
  verbatim, no auto-namespacing — the attribute namespace can differ from the
  name domain, e.g. `session.turn` carries `turn.*`).
- `kind` — optional override of the coarse category
  (`session|model|tool|subagent|skill|memory|plugin`). Default derived from the
  name's domain; pass explicitly for custom nodes (§3).

Nesting is automatic via `contextvars`: a span opened while another is active
becomes its child; context survives `await` and is snapshotted onto tasks. The
root of a turn is a `session.turn` span; everything else nests beneath it.

### `Span` handle

| method | effect |
|---|---|
| `s.set(attributes=None, **kw)` | merge attributes onto the span (dotted-key mapping and/or bare kwargs) |
| `s.artifact(key, payload, *, kind="json")` | persist a large payload out-of-line; attach `<key>.artifact_path/_sha1/_bytes` + a truncated `preview`. Use for prompts / tool IO / recall results. |
| `_spans.address_items(items)` | content-address a list of messages under `audit-artifacts/_messages/`; returns `{"$msg": sha1}` references to embed in a payload. See `audit.artifact.v2` below. |
| `s.event(name)` | append a timeline event `{time, name}` |
| `s.error(exc)` | mark `status = ERROR` (done automatically if the block raises) |

Read-only: `s.trace_id`, `s.span_id`, `s.name`.

### Module helpers

| call | returns |
|---|---|
| `trace.enabled()` | whether recording is on (config/env) |
| `trace.current()` | the active `TraceCtx` or `None` |
| `trace.use_context(ctx)` | context manager: re-enter a context captured with `current()`, for a span opened outside the turn that scheduled the work (a queue drained by a long-lived worker) |

### Hard guarantees (why an adopter is safe)

1. **No-op when off.** When tracing is disabled, `trace.span(...)` yields a
   no-op handle: no spans or artifacts are written, and the `with` block runs
   normally.
2. **Error boundaries.** Span creation, span emission, and artifact persistence
   catch internal exceptions and log them at debug level. When tracing is
   enabled and span creation succeeds, exceptions raised inside the `with`
   block are re-raised after marking the span as an error. The handle methods
   require correctly typed inputs: for example,
   `s.set(42)` raises `TypeError`, which also propagates out of the block.
   Pass a mapping as `s.set({...})` or `s.set(attributes={...})`;
   `attrs` is not an alias and would be stored as an ordinary attribute key.
   When tracing is disabled, the no-op handle ignores these arguments, so
   `s.set(42)` does not raise. Enabling tracing can therefore expose argument
   errors that were hidden while it was off.
3. **Import-safe.** Importing `raven.tracing` and calling the API must succeed
   even with no config present.

### `@trace.instrument(...)` — the decorator (primary adopter mechanism)

Adopters instrument a method by annotating it — the body is untouched, so this
does not change core logic (only adds an observation wrapper):

```python
from raven.observability import semconv

@trace.instrument("llm.call", extract=semconv.llm_call)
async def chat_with_retry(self, ...): ...
```

`trace.instrument(name, *, kind=None, detached=False, root=False, seed=None, on_open=None, extract=None)`
wraps a sync **or** async method:

- `extract(span, bound_args, result, exc)` — runs in `finally` (input captured
  even on error); fills final attributes/artifacts. `bound_args` is the call's
  arguments by name; `result` is the return (`None` on error); `exc` the raised
  exception (`None` on success). The standard extractors live in
  `raven.observability.semconv` (`llm_call`, `tool_call`, `memory_*`, …).
- `seed(bound_args) -> dict` — returns `session_key` / `channel` / `chat_id` to
  open a *root* span (a turn) whose identity every child inherits.
- `on_open(span, bound_args)` — runs right after open, before the body; used to
  record input and `span.checkpoint()` an in-progress root for live viewing.

Extra `Span` methods used by extractors: `span.retype(name, kind)` (a `tool.call`
that turns out to be a `skill.read`), `span.cancel()` (drop a conditional span,
e.g. `skill.inject` only when something was injected), `span.checkpoint()`,
`span.elapsed_ms()`. Pass `detached=True` for a leaf marker that does NOT become
the active parent — required for cancellable spans so a child that opened before
the cancel doesn't dangle off an unemitted span.

Every span family is instrumented this way — including `subagent.run`: a
subagent runs the same decorated primitives (`chat_with_retry` / `tools.execute`),
so its spans are captured by those decorators and nest under the `subagent.run`
node automatically via the contextvars snapshot `asyncio.create_task` takes at
spawn. No monkeypatch is used anywhere.

## 2. Semantic conventions (standard span kinds)

`kind` is a single-word category (drives node coloring/grouping). `name` is the
`<domain>.<verb>` identifier (drives the label + rendering). Attributes are
namespaced by domain. Adopters SHOULD populate the "required" columns; "optional"
adds richer rendering.

| name | kind | required | optional attributes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session.turn` | `session` | — | `turn.input_preview`, `turn.output_preview`, `turn.in_progress`, `turn.capabilities.{tools,plugins,skills}` |
| `llm.call` | `model` | `llm.provider`, `llm.model` | `llm.provider_class`, `llm.finish_reason`, `llm.call_id`, `llm.invocation_source`, `llm.usage.{input,output,total,cache_read,cache_write}_tokens`, `llm.usage.cost_total`, `llm.request_{bytes,images,image_bytes}`, `llm.http_status`, `llm.served_by`, `llm.response_id`; artifacts `llm.input` (`audit.artifact.v2`: message references + tools, plus `request` = the messages+tools payload size and picture count, not the provider-final body, and `generation` = what the call asked the model for; see below), `llm.output` (plus `call` = the transport record) |
| `tool.call` | `tool` | `tool.name` | `tool.call_id`, `tool.duration_ms`, `tool.error`; artifacts `tool.input` (params), `tool.output` (result) |
| `subagent.run` / `subagent.call` | `subagent` | — | `subagent.id`, `subagent.label`, `subagent.task`, `subagent.session_id`, `subagent.parent_trace_id`, `subagent.parent_span_id`, `subagent.trace_id`, `subagent.status` |
| `skill.read` / `skill.inject` | `skill` | — | `skill.name`, `skill.id`, `skill.source`, `skill.path`, `skill.scripts_dir` (present => a runnable bundle was materialized, vs instructions-only), `skill.read.via_tool` (`use_skill`/`read_skill`/`read_file`), `skill.inject.{names,count,via}` |
| `memory.recall` / `.store` / `.feedback` / `.extract` / `.consolidate` / `.profile_refresh` | `memory` | — | `memory.scope`, `memory.hits`, `memory.message_count`, `memory.kind`, `memory.deposit_summary`, `memory.deposit_status`, `memory.surface`, `memory.sections_rewritten`; artifacts per op |
| `plugin.load` / `tracing.bootstrap` | `plugin` | — | `plugin.name`, `plugin.contribution`, `plugin.id` |

### Artifact formats

An artifact is either a plain JSON payload (v1, no discriminator) or
`audit.artifact.v2`, which carries `"artifactFormat": "audit.artifact.v2"` and
replaces each message with a `{"$msg": "<sha1>"}` reference to
`audit-artifacts/_messages/<sha1[:2]>/<sha1>.json`. Only `llm.input` is written
this way; every other kind stays v1, and a v1 artifact already on disk is never
rewritten. A shell's `request` and `generation` are carried verbatim: neither
holds message content, so referencing them would cost an indirection and save
nothing.

`raven/tracing/artifact_v2.py` is the format's single authority - canonical
serialization, envelope, reference validation, resolution - because the bundled
viewer mirrors it in JavaScript and a cross-language round-trip test compares
the two. A consumer that resolves a shell must apply two rules: `messages`
resolves to the list of message objects, while `systemPrompt` and `prompt`
resolve to their message's `content` coerced to text. A reference whose sha1 is
not 40 lowercase hex characters is data, not an address, and is passed through
untouched; a shell may also carry a raw message inline where its blob could not
be written.

For `llm.input`, `artifact_sha1` and `artifact_bytes` describe the shell, not
the conversation it references; `llm.request_bytes` is the request-size signal,
measured from the messages themselves and so unaffected by the shell. The shell
hashes over the references it lists, so tamper evidence localizes to one
message rather than only proving the payload changed.

Two resolution points turn a shell back into its v1 equivalent:
`raven/trajectory/bundle.py` when packing a trajectory (so a bundle carries no
dependency on the message store) and `readArtifact` in the bundled viewer's
`server.js` (so the UI never sees a reference). Consumers downstream of either
- replay, cassette minimization, the viewer's UI - read v1 shapes and need no
knowledge of v2.

**Provider labeling:** `llm.provider` is the *logical backend* the call routes to
(e.g. `openrouter`), derived from the model's gateway prefix; `llm.provider_class`
is the concrete class (e.g. `LiteLLMProvider`) when it differs. `llm.served_by` is a
third thing: the backend the *response* names as having served the call, present only
when the upstream says so, which behind a gateway that fans out is the only way to tell
which one answered.

**The transport record.** `llm.output`'s `call` object holds what the exchange did rather
than what the model said: `http_status`, `served_by`, `served_model`, `response_id`,
`headers`, and `body` -- the last filled only when the call delivered nothing, so a
usable answer is never stored twice. It is built solely by
`raven.providers.call_record`, which caps the body and the headers and replaces the value
of any credential-named header; nothing else may construct one. A request's own bytes are
never copied into a record: `llm.input`'s `request` object counts them
(`bytes` on the wire, `images`, `imageBytes` decoded) and image payloads are counted, not
logged.

Naming rules:
- `name` = `<domain>.<verb>`, lowercase dotted.
- attribute keys = `<domain>.<field>`, following the semantic conventions above;
  the attribute namespace can differ from the span name, as with `turn.*` on `session.turn`.
- kind is a closed vocabulary: `session|model|tool|subagent|skill|memory|plugin`.

## 3. Custom nodes

Any adopter (or plugin) may record a custom span — no registration required:

```python
with trace.span("raven.sentinel.tick", {"sentinel.reason": r}, kind="plugin") as s:
    s.set({"sentinel.fired": n})
```

Rules:
- Use an **owned namespace** for `name` (`raven.<subsystem>.<verb>`) to avoid
  clashing with the standard names in §2.
- Pass `kind` explicitly (falls back to a generic node kind otherwise).
- The viewer renders unknown names generically (title from `name`, subtitle from
  a chosen attribute). For bespoke rendering, ship a **descriptor** entry
  (`descriptors/*.json`) whose `type` field matches the span's `name`.
  Bundled descriptors are shipped under `raven/cli/tracing_viewer/descriptors/`;
  the viewer merges descriptor entries by `type`.

## 4. Adopter integration contract (raven)

1. Tracing ships inside Raven as `raven.tracing`; no separate `raven-tracing`
   dependency or `raven[tracing]` extra is required.
2. `from raven.tracing import trace` at instrumentation sites; wrap the operation
   in `with trace.span(...)`. Instrumentation lives in the app's own code, moves
   with refactors, and is visible in diffs (no external monkeypatch to silently
   break).
3. Enable/disable via `[tracing].enabled` (raven config) or `RAVEN_TRACING=0`
   (env override). The API no-ops when disabled.
4. The app never imports the SDK internals (storage/viewer) — only the facade.

Raven adds instrumentation explicitly through `@trace.instrument` and
`trace.span` in its own source. It does not install a monkeypatch-based probe.
Keep instrumentation tests with the affected code when refactoring.

## 5. Versioning & governance

The API versioning rules below are proposed for the standalone distribution;
they do not describe an independently versioned package shipped by Raven today.

- The API + semantic conventions are versioned together as `standard-api.v1`,
  independent of the app.
- **Additive** changes (new optional attribute, new span name/kind) → minor bump,
  backward compatible.
- **Breaking** changes (rename/remove an attribute or the API signature) → major
  bump + a migration note; adopters pin a supported range and warn (not silently
  degrade) on mismatch.
- A conformance snapshot test (frozen span names + required fields) should guard
  the standalone contract in CI and require a version bump for contract changes.
- On-disk record format is versioned separately as `audit.span.v1`
  (defined in `raven/tracing/spans.py`); the two move independently.

## Status

In-tree, complete. Every span family (turn / llm / tool / memory / skill.inject /
plugin.load / subagent) is instrumented with `@trace.instrument` on raven's own
methods; there is no monkeypatch and no `instrument.install()` — the auto-probe
module was removed. `raven.observability.semconv` already owns the Raven-specific
attribute/artifact builders, separately from the tracing machinery.

Remaining for the standalone-OSS phase (P4), none blocking in-tree use:
- Make the import optional: raven core hard-imports `raven.tracing` at module load
  (decorators applied at class-definition time), so it must ship with raven; a
  no-op fallback shim is needed before tracing can be a truly optional extra.
- Keep the Raven-specific extractors in `raven.observability.semconv`; package
  only the generic API + schema + viewer in the standalone distribution.
- Decouple Raven-specific defaults and path resolution (`FRAMEWORK`, `RAVEN_*`
  env, `~/.raven` paths) from the standalone package.
- Freeze `standard-api.v1`; publish `raven-tracing`; raven default-depends on it.
