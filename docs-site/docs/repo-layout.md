# Repo Layout

The shared Python runtime is in `raven/`. The repository also contains agent
definitions, plugin distributions, frontends, and development tools.

Key directories:

```text

agents/                # Specialized agents assembled from installed Raven and plugins
plugins-dist/          # everos-memory, design-engine, and ppt-engine distributions
ui-web/                # Browser UI, also used by the desktop window
ui-tui/                # React/Ink terminal UI
