# Docker Deployment

Raven's Compose deployment builds the WebUI and Python environment into one
image. nginx serves the WebUI, while the Raven engine handles RPC, messaging
channels, scheduled tasks, and other gateway services.

## Start the container

To build and run the current source checkout, start from the repository root:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up --build
```

To run the configured image without building the checkout, use
`docker compose up --no-build` from `docker/`. Plain `docker compose up` may
reuse or pull an image; it does not guarantee a rebuild of local changes.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:18793` after the container is ready. The default local
configuration signs you in automatically.

## What runs in the image

The deployment runs two processes in a single container:

| Process | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| nginx on port 80 | Serves the built WebUI and proxies browser requests to the engine. |
| Raven engine | Runs the RPC gateway on `127.0.0.1:18793` inside the container. |

The engine binds to loopback inside the container, so nginx and the engine stay
together. The WebUI and Python environment are built from the same source
checkout.

## Sign in

Compose sets `RAVEN_AUTO_LOGIN=1` by default, so browsers accessing the local
WebUI receive a session automatically. This setting is intended for a port
accessible only from the local machine.

For a remotely exposed deployment, put `RAVEN_AUTO_LOGIN=0` in `.env.local`.
The entrypoint prints a one-time sign-in URL when the container starts. The
session cookie is valid for 30 days and survives container restarts because
its credential is retained in the persistent data volume.

To create another sign-in URL inside the running container:

```bash
docker compose exec raven docker-entrypoint.sh signin
```

## Configure a provider

Unless a provider is preconfigured, add one under **Settings > Model providers**.
It becomes available on the next turn without a restart.

To configure a provider before startup, put these values in `.env.local`:

```bash
RAVEN_PROVIDER=anthropic
RAVEN_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

For a local provider that does not require an API key:

```bash
RAVEN_PROVIDER=ollama-chat
RAVEN_API_KEY=
RAVEN_API_BASE=http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

Docker Desktop provides `host.docker.internal`. On Linux Docker Engine, add
a host-gateway mapping for that name or use a host address reachable from the
container. The model server must listen on that address, with access restricted
to the intended clients.

The entrypoint applies these provider values to Raven's configuration on each
startup. Values set here take precedence when the container restarts.

## Configure environment values

The `docker/.env` file contains committed defaults. For container runtime
variables such as `RAVEN_PROVIDER`, `RAVEN_API_KEY`, and `RAVEN_AUTO_LOGIN`,
the service loads the optional `docker/.env.local` file second as an
`env_file`. Store credentials there; Git ignores it.

Compose interpolation is separate. `RAVEN_IMAGE`, `RAVEN_WEB_PORT`,
`RAVEN_EXTRAS`, `RAVEN_PLUGINS`, and `RAVEN_OFFICE` determine the image,
published port, or build arguments before the container starts. Merely putting
them in the service's `.env.local` file does not override those settings.
From `docker/`, provide them in the shell environment, for example:

```bash
RAVEN_IMAGE=raven:local RAVEN_WEB_PORT=18893 docker compose up --build
```

Alternatively, after creating `.env.local`, explicitly load it for interpolation
as well:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.local up --build
```

The later file overrides the earlier one for interpolation; shell environment
values take precedence over both files.

## Persistent data

Raven stores configuration, workspace files, sessions, logs, and memory under
`/data` in the `raven-data` volume. Removing the container keeps this volume.
The command below deletes the volume and all data in it:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Run a CLI command

Arguments other than `run` and `signin` are passed to the Raven CLI:

```bash
docker compose exec raven docker-entrypoint.sh provider test anthropic
docker compose run --rm raven status
```

## Deployment limits

- The default Compose page grants a browser session to anyone who can reach
  the published port. Keep the default binding on `127.0.0.1`, or set
  `RAVEN_AUTO_LOGIN=0` and add a proxy with its own access control before
  exposing the service remotely.
- The image does not terminate TLS. Use an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of the
  container for remote deployments.
- The TUI is not built into the image. `raven tui` needs the bundle from
  `ui-tui/`.
- The `sandbox` extra is disabled by default; commands run within the container.
  Include it through `RAVEN_EXTRAS` if you also need Boxlite.
- LibreOffice is included for office-file previews. Build with
  `RAVEN_OFFICE=0` if your deployment does not need office-file previews.
