"""Whether this environment is one Raven may run out of.

``system.upgrade`` makes the serving process exit on purpose and leaves a
detached helper to run ``uv tool install --force``, which deletes the old
environment before it writes the new one. A supervisor that respawns the
process it just watched exit therefore races the installer, and a start that
lands inside that window is not merely slow -- it is permanently wrong:
``build_app`` picks the page route once, so a serve that came up before
``raven/ui/dist`` existed answers ``/`` with the placeholder for the rest of
its life, on an installation that is by then perfectly good.

Two facts are needed to close that window, and neither is enough alone. The
marker says an upgrade is mid-flight even while the environment still looks
whole (uv has not started deleting yet). The completeness check says the
environment is not whole even when no marker survives (the helper was killed).
