"""One RPC call into the raven that is serving the page, from a terminal.

A stint's rounds run inside whichever process holds the driver. A CLI verb
that opens a round -- ``stints resume``, ``stints extend`` -- used to build a
driver of its own and hold the terminal while the round ran, which is right on
a machine with no raven running and wrong on one with a page up: the round then
runs in a shell process nobody is watching, reports to nobody, and dies with
the shell (measured 2026-09-20: a model, told to resume, ran the verb through
its exec tool, the tool's timeout killed it, and the round with it).

So the verb asks first whether a page is being served, and if so sends the
call there. The page's raven has the driver, the conversation the stint was
started in, and the announcer that conversation reads.
