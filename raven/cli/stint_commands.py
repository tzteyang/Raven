"""``raven playbook stint`` subapp: lay a project out for a stint, and work its backlog.

``init`` writes ``.stint/`` -- a guard file per role, the shared prose, and a
link to the project's own specification -- which is what a ``mode: stint``
playbook reads before its first round. The rest is the backlog the roles share:
``task`` moves one card through the state machine, ``ask`` files a question for
a person, and ``confirm`` is the person's word that the stint is the stint.

Nothing here starts a run. A run is a playbook (`raven playbook run <name>`),
and these verbs are what a person uses around it.
