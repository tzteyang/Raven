"""Typer subcommand: `raven tui` — launch the Ink+React TUI subprocess.

Bootstrap stage (L2-α `tui-bootstrap`): pure Node spawn, no IPC.
IPC stage (`tui-ipc-bridge`): we additionally open two POSIX
pipes (request + notify), pass them to the Node child as fd 3 / fd 4, and
run a `RpcServer` in an asyncio task that handles `system.hello` (5 s
handshake timeout → exit 3) plus subsequent business RPC methods.

Exit codes (in addition to bootstrap's 0/1/2):
