"""`raven a2a`: the inbound A2A face, and the switch that opens it.

``serve`` is the headless hosting. The gateway-mounted one is
``gate.mount_gateway_face``, called from the app builder; both refuse in a
sub-agent process through the same check, so neither can be the one that forgot.

The two are not gated alike, which is easy to misread as an oversight: the config
flag decides only the gateway-mounted face, because running ``serve`` is itself
the opt-in for that one. ``enable`` and ``disable`` write that flag, and they are
the only thing that does -- an install finishes with the face closed, so opening
a second network surface is always something an operator typed.
