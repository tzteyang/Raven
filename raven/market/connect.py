"""Install-and-connect: the one transaction behind every plugin surface.

The disk transaction lives in :mod:`raven.market.install`; what lives here is
everything that has to happen *around* it -- the catalog lookup, the id rules,
the bounded connect kick, the rollback rule ("authentication failed => the
plugin was not installed"), the re-authorization retry and the removal.

Two callers share it: the panel drives it over RPC, the agent's own ``plugin``
tool drives it in-process from a turn. A rule with two implementations is two
rules, and this one decides whether a user's config keeps a server they never
authorized.

Refusals leave as :class:`PlugConnectError` carrying the structured ``data``
the RPC layer echoes into ``error.data``; that layer translates them to its own
error type and the tool renders them as text.

Connect kicks are bounded by :data:`CONNECT_WAIT`: an OAuth connect legitimately
parks in the browser for minutes, so a mutating call returns the current
snapshot after a few seconds and the ``mcp.status`` / ``oauth.pending`` events
carry the rest of the story.

Both callers hand the loop through its MCP control face (paper:
:mod:`raven.contracts.mcp_host`) -- the three members named there are all this
module may reach of it.
