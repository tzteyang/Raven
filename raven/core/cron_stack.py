"""Cron assembly for the runtime: the ``on_cron_job`` factory every entrance wires.

Used by the gateway, the REPL, the TUI and the rpc stack alike; it composes the
cron service with the spine (a reminder fires as a CRON-origin turn) and the
sentinel ledger, which is assembly, not transport.

A scheduled reminder fires as a CRON-origin spine turn bound to the
``cron:<job_id>`` session. Delivery is direct: the turn's source is the
job's creation-time binding ``(payload.channel, payload.to)``, so the hub
routes the reply to that one outlet — fire-at-origin, no trigger-time
re-routing.

    """Build the CronService.on_job callback. Every cron turn runs through the
    spine ``submit`` as a CRON-origin turn.

    ``submit`` (required) is the spine entry (build_gateway / build_one_shot_spine /
    build_rpc_spine scheduler). The turn's source is the job's creation-time
    binding ``(payload.channel, payload.to)`` — the single delivery target.
    The hub routes the reply to that channel's outlet; there is no
    trigger-time resolution, forwarding, or broadcast.

    ``readback_texts`` is build_gateway's per-conversation reply-text map, the
    spine read-back channel for the system event: a CRON turn submits, then this
    reads back its reply from ``readback_texts[cron:<job_id>]`` (the runner stored
    it before result() resolved) and pops it. The submitter cannot pass run_turn's
    text_sink itself — text_sink is a runner-set per-call param, and cron is a
    submitter — so the gateway's capturing runner bridges it. Required whenever
    ``submit`` is wired; without it the system event sees no reply text.

    ``default_channel`` is used when the job payload doesn't specify one
    (legacy pre-attribution jobs) — every runner passes "tui" so such a
    job surfaces in the interactive TUI session (the "cli" channel value
    is retired).

    ``sentinel_runner`` is optional. When present, cron fires
    write to the shared NudgePolicy ledger (topic_fired_at +
    record_dispatched) so the L3 Sentinel suppresses its own proactive
    nudges on the same topic within the dedup window. Without this,
    Sentinel and Cron are blind to each other and the user gets double-
    nudged on the same subject (e.g. user-asked "5/25 birthday cron"
    fires AND Sentinel proactively reminds at 5/22).

    ``system_events`` / ``wake`` are optional. When wired (gateway path),
    each completed or failed cron run enqueues a system event and requests
    an early heartbeat tick, so the main heartbeat session learns what
    happened in the isolated ``cron:<job_id>`` session and can decide on
    follow-ups.
    Only effective for jobs executed in this process — a CLI test-fire
    runs in its own process and cannot reach the gateway's queue.

    ``cron_service`` is optional. When wired, each successful recurring
    fire ('every'/'cron' kinds; one-shots can't run away) is counted via
    ``record_fire`` — the anti-runaway guard that auto-disables a job
    after ``silent_fire_limit`` consecutive fires with no user activity
    on its (channel, to). Failed turns are not counted: a job that never
    delivers is a different problem than one that spams. On auto-disable
    the in-memory job is flipped too, so the service's post-run writeback
    persists the disable instead of recomputing a next run.

    ``make_on_cron_job`` runs a fired job as a reminder to the main agent on a
    conversation of the job's own (``cron:<job_id>``), and the surface shows the
    reply through the tui fan-out. An ACP client has neither: it learns what an
    agent does from ``session/update`` on the session it subscribed to, and a
    turn run anywhere else is a round that happened where nobody is listening.
    Measured 2026-09-04 on a /new-instance on-call session: two wakes fired,
    fifteen trials ran, the campaign closed and its report went out -- and not
    one frame reached the client after the operator's last prompt.

    So the job runs ON the session that scheduled it. The session is not looked
    up: a job records the ``(channel, to)`` of the turn that created it, the ACP
    prompt gives every turn the pair that rebuilds its own session key, and
    ``<channel>:<chat_id>`` IS that key. The wake's text goes in verbatim -- the
    on-call agent is the addressee and a wake turn's message is the whole of what
    it gets -- and the origin stays CRON so the loop's cron-context guard applies.
    A prompt in flight is unaffected: the translator defers a runtime turn's
    ending rather than letting it answer the prompt.
