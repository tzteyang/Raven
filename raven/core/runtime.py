"""build_runtime: the one place a running agent is assembled from config.

The mapping from config keys to cargo bundles lives here once: an entrance
brings its transport-side wiring (policy and host) and takes back a runtime;
what it may NOT do is derive a cargo bundle by hand. The parity guard

    """One assembled generation of the agent: the loop plus the parts an
    entrance still needs handles to after construction.

    Frozen: FREEZE is the last of the composition phases (COLLECT, ADMIT,
    BIND, START, FREEZE), and this is its machine. After construction a
    generation is sealed -- a change is generation N+1 through the swap path,
    never an in-place mutation of N. The members it holds stay live objects
    with their own lifecycles; what cannot change is which objects this
    generation is made of.

    Member identity is what FREEZE seals; a member's own data plane stays
    that member's business, and exactly three doors reconcile it
    mid-generation. What makes a door legal: it reconciles an organ's data
    to the already-written durable truth, it is safe while turns run, and it
    touches no member identity -- so a swap right after yields the same
    config-derived composition state (membership and the registered tool
    surface; deliberately NOT retry/attempt state, and NOT in-flight work,
    whose preservation is a door's purpose):

    - the agents table, ``loop.apply_agents``: the registry's one write
      path, shared with startup. Its durable truth is the config file plus
      the discovered vendored/builtin seeds -- a vendored build hot-applies
      after a filesystem change with no config write, and that is the same
      truth.
    - the MCP server set, ``loop.apply_mcp_config``: reconciles membership
      to ``tools.mcpServers``; rows parked in error are deliberately not
      retried here (``connect()`` is the retry door). The manager's
      per-server verbs are that organ's own vocabulary for its declared
      operators (paper: contracts/mcp_host.py).
    - the default binding, ``loop.set_default_binding``: re-points the
      fallback the subagent manager, the context engine and the consolidator
      hold, after the config write that is its truth.

    Not doors, by scope: session-owned state (a session's binding, modes,
    per-session MCP adoption), preferences read through ``config/live.py``
    (whose docstring is the recorded contrast class), and process-lifetime
    globals outside the generation. Composition-level plugin contributions
    (hooks, memory backends) cannot board mid-generation at all -- the
    market refuses ``python``-kind pieces, so they arrive at the next
    generation through ``build_runtime``. The door roster and its operators
    are pinned by the guard in tests/test_core_runtime_swap.py.
