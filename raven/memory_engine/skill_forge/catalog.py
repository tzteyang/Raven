"""LocalSkillCatalog — the single owner of the local skill pool.

It builds the :class:`SkillRegistry` and :class:`LocalPool`, runs the SKILL.md
file watcher, and renders skills for the prompt (always-skills, injection, XML

Retrieval is **not** here: it lives in :class:`LocalSkillSource`, which reuses
this catalog's ``pool`` and ``registry``, and is fused with the remote sources
by :class:`SkillForgeRouter`, with the LLM gate and query rewriter downstream
of the fusion.
