"""LLM gate — relevance filter over RRF-fused router candidates.

The gate runs after :class:`SkillForgeRouter` fan-out + RRF: it sees
the candidate name + description + a short body excerpt and asks an LLM
to plan, filter against the agent's available tools and against the
sub-agents it can delegate to, and pick at most ``max_select`` skills.
Both filters are supplied per call and each renders its own block only
when it was given one. Empty result is a valid "inject nothing"
decision. Infra failures (parse error, timeout, provider error) fall
back to ``candidates[:legacy_top_k]`` rather than [] so a broken gate
never silently empties the ``# Skills`` block.
