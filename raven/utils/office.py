"""Convert a document with LibreOffice headless, and leave nothing running.

The viewer renders a deck to show it and the ppt engine
renders one to measure it, and both need the same three things: an argv that
makes LibreOffice convert without asking anything, a profile of its own for that
run, and a teardown that reaches the process doing the work. Those were written
twice, identically, and had diverged within a day of the second copy landing --
one of them knew about Windows and the other did not. What is not here is what
differs: each caller keeps its own timeout, its own idea of what counts as
failure, and its own place to put the file.

Two callers, not every caller. The design engine converts Office documents too,
through a backend of its own with its own error codes, worker directories and
configured executable; it predates this module and has not been brought through
it. Saying so is the point: the copy this module ends came back once already
because a docstring claimed something the tree did not do.

**A shared user profile silently loses a conversion.** LibreOffice allows one
instance per profile; a second invocation against the same profile hands its
request to the running instance and exits 0, having written nothing. Two decks
rendering at once is ordinary here, so every call gets a profile of its own.

**Killing the launcher is not killing the conversion.** ``soffice`` is a shell
wrapper that execs ``oosplash``, which forks ``soffice.bin``; a timeout that kills
the wrapper leaves the real process holding the profile directory open. On POSIX
the run gets a session of its own and the teardown kills the group. Native
Windows has neither ``os.killpg`` nor ``SIGKILL`` and ignores ``start_new_session``,
so the run asks for a process group there instead, the teardown signals it with
CTRL_BREAK and then finishes the tree with ``taskkill /T``. ``Popen.kill`` is the
last resort on both, because a process outside any group we can name is still one
we started.

**Exit 0 is not proof of output, and stderr is not proof of failure.** LibreOffice
reports success for documents it could not load, and a stock container prints
``failed to launch javaldx`` on every run. So this returns what appeared and what
was said, and the caller decides what that means.
