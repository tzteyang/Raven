"""Turn-scoped state the permission gate reads: who can be asked, and what was
already refused this turn.

Bound by an entrance inside the task that runs the turn (the same discipline as
``ToolRegistry.session_scope``): a request handler's context does not reach the
turn's task, so binding anywhere else binds nothing. A background origin binds
``None`` explicitly rather than leaving the previous turn's capability in the
context.

Sub-agent tasks inherit the parent turn's context by asyncio's own rule, so a
responder bound here can be visible inside a spawned agent's task. That is why
interactivity is not decided by this module alone: a registry built for an
unattended surface carries ``allow_ask=False`` on its gate, which outranks
whatever this context holds.
