"""User rules and default tiers: which standing one tool call has.

The user's ``permissions.tools`` node maps a tool name to a tier, or -- for
``exec`` -- to a table of command patterns each mapping to a tier. Several
matching rules resolve to the strictest (deny > ask > allow), never to the one
written last. A call no rule speaks about falls to the tool's default tier:
read-only tools run, everything else asks -- with one exception, and
``DEFAULT_ALLOW_TOOLS`` says why it is there: ``deliver_files`` hands the user
a file they asked for, which is not a read and is not an effect they approve.
``exec`` is the one tool whose default reads its argument: a command every
segment of which only reads (``READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`` and its three companions)
allows, everything else asks.

Exec pattern matching is prefix-by-token on the raw command, deliberately
without wrapper stripping: ``git *`` must not allow ``sudo git push``. A
compound command allows only when every segment allows. Segments come from the
shell lexer, so punctuation inside quotes stays text; what the lexer hands back
as its own token is shell syntax, and three kinds of it narrow what a rule may
say. Command and process substitution, backticks and heredocs run something
the token view cannot see, so the whole command answers only to a ``*`` rule.
A redirection is lifted out before matching and its target judged on its own:
a relative path without ``..`` lands under whatever the cwd is and changes
nothing, ``/dev/null`` and an fd dup write nothing, and any other target -- an
absolute path, ``~``, a variable -- again leaves only ``*`` rules. ``$VAR``
inside a word stays a word: expansion splits words, it cannot make a command
boundary. The builtin classifier (``raven.permissions.builtin``) keeps its own,
stripping view of the same command; a rule here can never lift what it rules.

The same token view says what a session grant remembers and what prefix the
approval prompt may suggest (``exec_approval_shape``), and what a prefix typed
into that prompt may look like before it reaches the config
(``validate_exec_pattern``).

# raven.browser.policy deliberately reaches wider than the egress guard --
# web_fetch refuses loopback/private targets, the browser keeps them (a reader
# pointing the panel at their own dev server is a feature; link-local and
# non-http schemes are still refused, and RAVEN_BROWSER_BLOCK_PRIVATE is the
# deployment switch that closes the rest). That wider reach is a decided repo
# policy (policy.py), accepted here with the prompt skipped. The acting verbs
# (click, type, press) are absent on purpose -- they submit forms -- and ask
# once per site rather than per call; see ``builtin.session_keys``.
