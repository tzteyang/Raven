"""The platform's own rulings: what ships with the code and no config lifts.

Two rulings, in the order the waterfall consumes them. The unconditional deny
list holds catastrophe-class commands only -- disk devices, fork bombs, power
control, and a recursive delete aimed at the filesystem root or the home tree;
it outranks everything including a user allow rule, in every mode. The
command families the running surface declared via
``shell_policy.set_surface_approval_families`` (none by default; the runtime
and the ACP editor both declare deletion and the external-effect families
before building their loop) do not decide anything:
they name the prompt -- "Publish or push work to a remote" rather than the bare
command -- when the tiers land the call on one. Every mutation, deletes
included, answers to the permission tiers.

Both rulings read shell commands only. Classification is
``ShellCommandPolicy``'s -- lexical segmentation, wrapper stripping, embedded
shells, fail-closed on matcher errors -- reused in place rather than moved, so
its tests and its surface-registration hook keep their one home.
