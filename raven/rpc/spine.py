"""Spine wiring for the RPC turn path: the runner (a RpcTurnRunner driving
the agent loop's native run_turn with stream=True), the outlet that maps each
spine event to its wire event (token.delta / thinking.delta / tool.*), and the
sink that fires ``message.complete`` / ``error`` after the render barrier.

A client runs turns through spine (submit -> lane -> run_turn -> hub -> outlet).
All of token/reasoning/tool/Text flow through the hub to the RpcOutlet, so they
share one per-outlet FIFO. spine never imports rpc; rpc imports spine.

Why ``message.complete`` is fired from the sink (not from a stream-close): it is
an unconditional per-turn signal — the front-end clears its turn slot on it, so a
turn that streams nothing (empty reply, tool-only) must still emit it or the UI
wedges. The completion names the turn that ended, taken from the event: a turn the
runtime submits onto a busy lane must not be reported under the id of the client
turn queued behind it. The sink awaits ``wait_idle`` first so it lands after the
turn's last ``token.delta``; an empty turn never built a queue, so the barrier
returns at once. This is the REPL's ``result() -> wait_idle`` render barrier moved
into the sink.

    id on ``message.complete`` comes from the turn itself) and a ``teardown`` the
    caller awaits on exit (stop the scheduler, then close the hub's workers).
    ``on_turn_end`` lets turn.send drop its active-turn slot at each turn exit;
    ``on_turn_start`` lets it bind that slot to an inject's fallback turn when
    the spine starts one (see ``_make_rpc_sink``).

    ``direct_targets`` is the direct-chat map (conversation -> the sub-agent
    instance the in-flight turn was addressed to). Pass the same dict

    outlet and the sink tag their events with; defaults to a private map when no
    client wires one, which reads as "every turn is the main agent's".

    ``readback_texts`` is the cron read-back map (conversation -> reply text): the
    runner stores a CRON turn's reply there so the cron fan-out can deliver it as a
    cron.delivered event. Pass the same dict the cron callback reads; defaults to a
    private map when cron is not wired (e.g. tests).

    USER turn always, a SUBAGENT relay when a surface is watching its
    conversation, and no other origin -- a CRON or otherwise unattended turn is
