"""Connection-scoped client identity, carried by contextvars.

One dispatcher now serves several clients at once (the gateway's WebSocket
fan-in), and a handler receives only ``params: dict`` -- nothing names the
connection a frame arrived on. Rather than threading a connection object
through every handler signature, each transport binds a small mutable state
dict into a ContextVar for the lifetime of one connection. Every dispatch task
it spawns snapshots that context (``asyncio.create_task`` copies contextvars),
so all frames from one socket share the dict and frames from different sockets
never see each other's.

Two facts are stored today:

* the surface the client declared in ``system.hello`` (``"tui"`` / ``"page"`` /
  ``"shell"``): ``turn.send`` reads it back and stamps it onto the turn's
  ``Source``, which is how a trace can tell the GUI shell from the browser page
  from a relayed terminal on one gateway;
* how to reach this one connection (:func:`set_frame_sink`), plus the
  conversations it has sent turns for (:func:`claim_conversation`). A frame that
  interrupts a specific conversation -- an ask_user question -- then goes to the
  surface that started that turn instead of to every socket on the gateway; see
  :func:`conversation_scoped`.

A transport that never binds (or a client that never declares) leaves every
read returning ``None``, and both fall back to what they did before: tracing to
the process-wide ``raven.tracing.set_surface`` value, and an interrupting frame
to the transport's broadcast.
