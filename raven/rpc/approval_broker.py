"""Runtime-owned approval round-trip for protected tool calls.

The permission gate reaches this broker when a call lands on the ask tier.
The broker mints an ``approval_id``, emits ``approval.request`` to the client,
and blocks that tool call until the user answers. The broker grants nothing
itself: it carries the human's choice back -- once, for this session, or a
prefix rule to persist -- and the gate is what remembers or writes.
``suggested_pattern`` on the request is the prefix the gate found safe to
offer; a client that shows no editor for it simply never sends ``allow_always``.

The request carries what a prompt is drawn from, beside the action line the
gate already wrote: ``kind`` picks the layout, ``family`` the wording,
``origin`` names who is asking, and ``evidence`` is the tool's own account of
the call. The broker forwards them as given.

A request has no working deadline: it stays open until a person answers it,
the connection goes away (``cancel_all``) or the turn is cancelled. The default
``hard_timeout_s`` is a day -- a floor nobody present ever reaches, there so
that "waits forever" is not a state the runtime can be in -- and a host may set
a shorter ceiling; when it fires the outcome is a deny nobody chose. Every
backend outcome emits ``approval.closed`` in ``finally``, so a client can retire
an overlay whatever ended the request; the client matches the id before
clearing, so a delayed close cannot dismiss a newer request.

``pending`` lists the requests still open, as they were sent: a page that
reloaded lost its sheets, and this is how it draws them again. WHICH of them a
caller may see is the transport's to decide, not this broker's -- the requests
are kept whole here and the RPC boundary filters by who owns the conversation
(``rpc/methods/approval.py``).

A grant that writes a rule leaves a receipt. The gate persists AFTER this
broker's answer has already reached the client (measured: the respond call
returns first), so a client asking to undo cannot ask about "the rule matching
this text" -- at that moment there may be no rule yet, or there may be one the
person wrote themselves long ago. ``record_grant`` is how the gate says what its
write actually did, and ``written_pattern`` is how an undo waits for that word
and learns whether this answer is the reason a rule is on disk.

One question per conversation at a time. Both surfaces draw one prompt per
conversation and replace it when another lands, so a second request sent while
the first is open would take the first off the screen with nobody having
answered it -- and with no deadline behind it, that call would wait forever. A
background sub-agent asking while the main agent's prompt is up is the ordinary
way this happens. The second request is sent once the first is answered.
