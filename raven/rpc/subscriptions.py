"""SubscriptionEmitter — per-session subscription registry + 16ms coalesce loop.

Per-session subscription registry with a coalesce loop:

- Per-session subscription map (`session_key → [Subscription]`)
- Each subscription owns a bounded asyncio.Queue (capacity 512)
- 16ms coalesce loop merges consecutive `token.delta` events into one frame
- Queue overflow → emit error(code=-32010) + close subscription
- Non-token events pass through preserving order
- A turn in flight is buffered, so a subscription opened mid-turn is handed
  what already streamed before it sees anything live

Owned by the RPC server; passed to `register_turn_methods(dispatcher, emitter)`.
