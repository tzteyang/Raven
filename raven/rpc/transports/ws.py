"""aiohttp WebSocket + static transport for `raven serve`.

Browser auth bootstrap (Jupyter-style): the launcher mints a one-time nonce
and opens ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth#<nonce>``. The fragment never enters
the HTTP request line or server logs; the auth page POSTs it to
``/auth/exchange`` which burns the nonce and sets an HttpOnly SameSite=Strict
session cookie. The ``/rpc`` WebSocket upgrade and any future ``/files/*``
endpoints require that cookie (or an ``X-Raven-Token`` header for local
tooling), plus an Origin check when a browser sends one.

Multi-connection from day one (plan D3): every authenticated socket receives
all notification frames; request/response frames stay on the socket that sent
the request; concurrent-turn conflicts are already guarded by -32003.
