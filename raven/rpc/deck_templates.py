"""The bundled deck templates, for the page's template picker.

A deck on a template is the deck engine's work, and the engine runs only when a
turn hands it a ``.pptx`` (the route on ``agents/raven-design/subagent.json``
opens on that file). The picker is how a reader hands one over without owning a
copy: it shows the templates the engine ships, and picking one deposits that
file under ``<agent home>/uploads`` exactly as ``fs.upload`` would, so the same
path rides on ``turn.send`` and the same fence admits it.

The host does not import the engine. What it needs is a directory, and
``find_spec`` locates the installed package without executing it; a deployment
without the engine wheel simply has no templates to show. The covers are the
first page of each template, rendered through the deck viewer's own PDF cache
(``pdf_preview``) and rasterised with PyMuPDF where the engine's dependency
brought it (imported lazily, so the host's own dependency face stays as it
is) -- a host without either shows the names alone.
