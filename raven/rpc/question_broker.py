"""QuestionBroker — sync↔async ask-user round-trip keyed by conversation_id.

Generalizes :class:`ConfirmBroker` for the ``ask_user`` tool. The difference is
the key: a confirm mints its own ``request_id`` and that is the only handle the
caller has, whereas an ask_user round-trip is answered by an inbound channel
message whose only handle is the conversation_id. So the pending registry is
keyed by conversation_id; an internal request_id is still minted and carried in
the notification so a frontend that prefers to answer by request_id can.

Like ConfirmBroker it is transport-agnostic: constructed with a notification
emit callable (bound to ``RpcServer.send_frame`` in production), and every
fail-safe path (timeout, cancel, internal error, connection EOF via
:meth:`cancel_all`, and a surface that reports the question as undeliverable)
resolves to the prompt's ``default`` rather than raising — the agent loop must
always get a string back.

A batch answer is a separate concern from a single question's answer: a page
that renders a whole ``ask_user`` batch as one stepped form answers it in one
``clarify.respond``, but the tool loop on the other end still awaits the
batch's questions one at a time. So :meth:`reply` can carry the later
questions' answers alongside the current one, and the broker stashes them; the
loop's later :meth:`await_question` calls for the same conversation and batch
are then answered straight from the stash, with no further ``clarify.request``
round trip.
