"""``subagent.*`` -- the background work one conversation handed off.

Two reads over what the delegation path already writes. A ``spawn`` records
itself in the session's own metadata directory (see
:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.history`), under the flat node root it shares with
graph nodes: ``subagents/nodes/<node_id>.prompt.md`` written before dispatch,
then ``.out.md`` or ``.error.md``, beside a ``.meta.json``. Which of those ids
belong to a spawn comes from the registry, since the files no longer say.
Nothing here writes anything. The record is the audit trail the
run keeps for itself, and these two methods are the view of it the panel draws.

Graph runs are listed too, one row per node. They were deliberately left out at
first, on the grounds that ``dag.*`` already reads them behind a graph view that
shows structure a flat list cannot -- but the panel's question is "which agents
worked on this conversation", and answering it with only half of them was worse
than a little duplication. The graph is still where structure is read; this is
where a reader finds a node without knowing there was a graph. The rows carry
``run_id`` and ``node`` so opening one goes through ``dag.node``, the same reader
the graph uses, rather than a second copy of it here.

``kind`` says which of the two a row is (``spawn`` / ``dag``), because the two are
addressed differently and a client must not guess.

Singular, next to the plural ``subagents.*`` that configures which external
agents exist. The two are not variants of one name: a caller reaching for the
wrong one gets an empty list and no error, which is how these two managed to be
missing for as long as they were.

The session manager comes from the running loop when there is one, exactly as
``session.resume`` takes it. That is load-bearing rather than tidy: the group a
session's directory falls under is resolved through ``session_path``, which
adopts a transcript written before project grouping existed, so a manager built
fresh here could resolve the same key to a different directory and answer with an
empty panel for a run that is on disk.
