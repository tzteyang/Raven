"""session.* RPC handlers (lifecycle + management).

``session.create`` mints a fresh ``tui:<chat_id>`` key on every call (lazy —
no file is written until the session's first save). ``session.resume`` loads
the stored transcript from disk for a known ``session_id`` and falls back to a
fresh-minted key with empty messages for an unknown or absent id.
``session.close`` flushes any unpersisted messages of the named session.
``session.list`` returns tui-channel sessions sorted by updated_at desc.
``session.delete`` removes a session file and invalidates the cache.
``session.most_recent`` wraps find_most_recent_chat_id("tui").
``session.title`` sets or gets the title field in session metadata (lazy —
title persists on the next save that writes metadata).
``session.archive`` hides or restores a session through persisted metadata.

Wire shape for session.create/resume: the ``info`` field is the init bundle
consumed by ``ui-tui/src/components/branding.tsx`` (SessionPanel). Requires
``info.skills`` / ``info.tools`` / ``info.model`` — Object.entries(info.skills)
on line 138 will throw if these are missing.

``agent_loop=None`` graceful fallback: empty tools/skills, zero usage,
``lazy=True``. Mirrors ``turn.py``'s factory-exception guard.

Known divergence: ``system.hello`` still advertises ``default_session_key``
``tui:default`` and the ui-tui turn path still hardcodes it.
