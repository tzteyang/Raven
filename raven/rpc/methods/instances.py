"""``subagents.instance*`` RPC handlers: the sub-agent instances a session used.

A different noun from ``methods/subagents.py``, which configures *which*
sub-agents exist. This group is about the instances a session has actually
talked to -- the things the direct-chat surface addresses.

Every read here goes through ``raven.agent.subagent.instances`` (the registry
and ``reconcile_instance_rows``) and the record directories the runtime writes,
rather than deriving a second answer here, so the TUI and the served page cannot
come to disagree about what an instance is or which ones are still alive.

The one write here is ``subagents.instance.create``: the user's own way to
start an instance, since every other creation path runs for the main agent.

No cancel method, and since a direct chat runs on its own lane
(``raven.spine.turn.direct_lane``) that now means it cannot be cancelled at all:
``turn.cancel`` looks up the *session's* turn, which is the main agent's. That is
the decision, not an oversight -- a sub-agent that is answering is left to finish
and its record is the evidence either way (see the concurrent-direct-chats
design, D3). ``SubagentManager.chat`` still unwinds cleanly if the lane is torn
down for another reason (shutdown, session delete): the record is finished
``cancelled`` and the registry row follows. A host where a spawn is a
background task with no turn to cancel reaches it over the wire through
``subagent.cancel_instance``.

    A graph declares every node up front, and the runner writes a registry row

    runner's own words: ``_mark_stopped`` turns a ``pending`` node into a
    ``skipped`` one because "a `pending` one was never dispatched, which is what
    `skipped` means everywhere else", and ``_cascade_failures`` skips whatever
    depended on a node that failed.

    Such a node has no conversation, no transcript and no handle of its own, so
    a list of the instances a conversation has used is the wrong place for it:

    second answer: with one completed ``synthesize`` and one skipped
    ``synthesize``, the completed run's handle row paired with neither, so the
    one invocation came back twice -- once un-attributed and once as the node --
