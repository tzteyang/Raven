"""RPC method handlers, one module per domain.

Each module exposes a ``register_<domain>_methods()`` helper; the umbrella
:func:`register_aligned_methods` calls every one of them, so a dispatcher
built by any spawn path (the TUI wrapper, ``raven serve``, ``raven acp``)
answers the same method set. The wire schema ``rpc-schema/openrpc.json`` is
the list of record for that set; ``tests/test_rpc_registration.py`` pins the
registered names against it, including the stub names that answer -32012 and
the declared names that answer -32601.
