"""``dag.get`` / ``dag.node`` RPC handlers.

A ``run_subagent_dag`` run publishes ``dag.*`` progress events while it executes,
and nothing replays them. These two read the run dir instead, so a TUI that was
not listening for every frame is not stuck with whatever it happened to catch:

* ``dag.get`` rebuilds (or repairs) a whole graph. An unfinalized run has no
  manifest, so the instance registry is overlaid on top -- see
  :func:`~raven.agent.subagent.dag_resume.read_run_reconciled`, shared with the
  sub-agent DAG control tools so a resumed graph reads the same from inside a
  turn and from this method.
* ``dag.node`` pulls one node's *rendered* prompt and its output, neither of
  which the graph carries: the manifest inlines only the leaf nodes' text, and
  the tool result the transcript keeps is clamped to 200 chars.
