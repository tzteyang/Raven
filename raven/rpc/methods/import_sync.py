"""``import.*`` RPC handlers: the onboarding wizard's data-sync step.

Named ``import_sync`` rather than ``import`` because the latter is a Python
keyword. These four handlers are a thin RPC skin over the same cold-start
importer ``raven import`` already drives (``raven.importer.*``): the web
wizard's sync step scans, starts, polls and cancels the identical pipeline the
CLI's ``raven import`` command wraps in questionary prompts and a Rich
progress bar. Only one import runs at a time inside this process: the slot is
claimed before ``import.run`` awaits anything, so two frames dispatched together
cannot both pass the guard and submit the same source twice.

After the message pass the run lands the same two phases the CLI does
(``raven.importer.phases``): the profile mirror and the skill install. Their
progress is this process's own knowledge, reported through ``import.status``
beside the counts the state file holds.
