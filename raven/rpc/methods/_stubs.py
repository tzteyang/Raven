"""Hermes-only stub RPC handlers.

These method names exist in the fork-imported hermes UI but Raven does not
back with real functionality. Rather than physically remove the
slash commands (which would inflate the fork-import diff and worsen future
upstream merges), we wire each name to a stub that raises
:class:`NotSupportedError` (JSON-RPC -32012). The hermes UI already has
an error-toast component that consumes this shape gracefully — the user types
the slash command and sees a transient "Not supported" toast.

The stub group covers the original 6 logical hermes-only groups (10 names)
plus the additional unaligned method names that ui-tui actually invokes but
Raven does not back with real functionality:

* ``voice.toggle`` / ``voice.record`` — voice features (original)
* ``browser.manage`` — browser automation (original)
* ``spawn_tree.save`` / ``spawn_tree.list`` / ``spawn_tree.load`` — hermes's
  sub-agent topology UX (Raven uses Sentinel/Subagent differently)
* ``process.stop`` — hermes's filesystem-rollback-aware turn killer; we route
  the user to Ctrl+C
* ``rollback.list`` / ``rollback.diff`` / ``rollback.restore`` — fs-level
  rollback (we point users at ``git`` instead)
* ``tools.configure`` — TUI-side tool config editor; in Raven users edit
  ``~/.raven/config.json`` directly
* ``session.{save, steer}`` — hermes session-mgmt slash commands Raven
  doesn't back yet (``session.{branch, compress, status, title, undo, usage}``
  were promoted to real handlers in methods/session.py)
* ``skills.reload`` — hermes skill hot-reload UX (Raven uses SkillForge
  closed loop, no manual reload trigger)
* ``reload.env`` — hermes env-file hot-reload (Raven reads env on process
  start only)
* ``sudo.respond`` / ``secret.respond`` — hermes interactive credential flows
* ``image.attach`` — hermes image-paste attachment
* ``prompt.submit`` / ``prompt.background`` — hermes "stash this prompt for
  later" flow; Raven only supports inline submit via the chat turn
  pipeline
