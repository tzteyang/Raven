"""``playbooks.*`` RPC handlers -- the playbook library as a client sees it.

The reads are deliberately two calls rather than one:

* ``playbooks.list`` answers a row per playbook *including the graph's shape*
  (each node's id and what it depends on, nothing else). The library page draws
  one concept diagram per card, and a card that had to fetch its own graph
  would turn opening the page into N round trips.
* ``playbooks.get`` answers one whole spec -- per-node prompts, skills, mcps,
  instance handles -- which is what the detail view's node panel reads.

A file that will not parse is a **row**, not a failed call: the library is two
directories of user-editable text, and one bad file must not take the page down
with it. Such a row carries ``error`` and an empty ``nodes``.
