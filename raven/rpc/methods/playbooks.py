"""``playbooks.*`` RPC handlers -- the playbook library as a client sees it.

The reads are deliberately two calls rather than one:

* ``playbooks.list`` answers a row per playbook *including the graph's shape*
  (each node's id and what it depends on, nothing else). The library page draws
  one concept diagram per card, and a card that had to fetch its own graph
  would turn opening the page into N round trips.
* ``playbooks.get`` answers one whole spec -- per-node prompts, skills, mcps,
  instance handles -- which is what the detail view's node panel reads.

A file that will not parse is a **row**, not a failed call: the library is two
directories of user-editable text, and one bad file must not take the page down
with it. Such a row carries ``error`` and an empty ``nodes``.

    """Remove a user playbook's directory.

    Refused for a builtin, which ships with the package: there is no file of the
    host's to remove, and the next install would put it back. Disabling is the
    operation that exists for those, and the refusal says so.

    The name comes off the deny list as it goes, for the reason the CLI records:
    a gone name has no business there, and a later playbook reusing it should
    start enabled like any other new one.

    A user playbook shadowing a builtin of the same name is the case worth
    knowing about: deleting it does not remove the name, it uncovers the
    builtin. The answer says which happened rather than leaving a caller to
    re-read the list to find out.

    Answers the executor's own plan verbatim -- ``kind`` and ``reply`` -- rather

    reply is the receipt (the run id is in it, and ``_run_id_of`` states why it
    lives in the text rather than in a field of its own); a ``prompt`` one comes
    back as composition guidance; ``gaps`` means nothing was dispatched and names
    what is still needed; ``questions`` says why it cannot proceed.

    ``session_key`` is required, and is the whole reason this is not a thinner
    wrapper. A run's progress and its completion announce are addressed to a
    conversation, which the loop sets per turn on every origin it knows about.
    An RPC call is an origin it does not: the address is a ``ContextVar`` whose
    every consumer falls back to a ``cli:direct`` default, so a page-initiated
    run would report somewhere nobody is looking. The key is the conversation's
    own ``channel:chat_id``, the same pair every origin dict carries.

    ``confirmed`` is the caller's own statement that it already put this run to
    the user, which is what the executor's gate reads to avoid asking a second
    time. Taken from the caller rather than assumed here: a page that shows a
    confirmation and one that fires on a single click are both legitimate, and
    only the page knows which it is. Asserting it on their behalf would skip the
