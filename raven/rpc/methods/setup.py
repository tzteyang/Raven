"""``setup.status`` RPC handler — provider configuration probe.

Why this exists
---------------

hermes's fork-imported ``useSessionLifecycle.ts,206`` + ``setupHandoff.ts``
hard-call ``setup.status`` on app boot. If the response is
``{provider_configured: false}`` the UI parks the user on a *Setup required*
panel and refuses to start a new session. The contract therefore has to be
honoured even in v0.1.

Q9 (partial answer): we treat ``agents.defaults.provider`` as the canonical
provider field. A concrete provider name (``"anthropic"`` / ``"openai"`` / …)
counts as *configured*; the sentinel value ``"auto"`` counts as
*not-yet-configured* (the user has not picked one and Raven has not run
auto-detection). If the config read fails on a present file — unparseable
JSON, an I/O error — the v0.1 fallback returns ``{"provider_configured": true}``
(design §3a.1) so the UI never blocks on a transient hiccup. A config file that
does not exist is not a hiccup: it is what a fresh install looks like, and the
web page opens its first-run wizard on exactly this answer, so it reports
``false``.
