"""Spine wiring for the gateway daemon: build_gateway assembles the scheduler,
the delivery hub with a per-channel outbound outlet, and a teardown -- the third
assembly point, mirroring build_one_shot_spine (cli) and build_rpc_spine (rpc) at their own
surfaces. It lives with the rest of the gateway plumbing because it wires exactly
one entrance; the cross-entrance assembly root (raven/core) holds only what every
entrance shares. The gateway's host sources (cron / sentinel / heartbeat, and
channel replies) submit through it.
