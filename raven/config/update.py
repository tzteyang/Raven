Unlike ``save_config`` which re-serializes the entire Pydantic model (and

    No schema default can carry this. The token is per-install secret material,

    the Skill Hub endpoint is seeded at onboard time rather than declared. An
    empty token is not a weak credential but a closed door: ``a2a/auth.py``
    refuses every caller while it is empty, so a face switched on without one
    would advertise a capability that answers nobody.

    ``enabled`` is not written here at all. The inbound face is a second network
    surface, and finishing an unrelated install is not consent to open one --
    ``set_a2a_server_enabled`` is, reached through ``raven a2a enable``. Leaving
    the key absent rather than writing ``false`` also keeps a repeat onboard
    from closing a face the operator opened by hand.

    A present token is the "already initialized" mark, and it is never rotated.

    The minting write is the one that fixes the file to owner-only, and it does
    so from the temp file's first byte rather than with a chmod afterwards.
    Nothing else narrows this config -- ``save_config`` creates it under the
    process umask, 0644 under the common one -- and it already holds provider
    API keys, so the narrowing is owed either way. A run that mints nothing
