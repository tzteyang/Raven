"""Config values that are allowed to change while the process runs.

Most of what a loop reads out of ``config.json`` is settled when it is built: a
provider is constructed, MCP servers are connected, a workspace root is resolved.
Those are expensive or stateful, and re-doing them mid-turn is a different
feature with different risks.

A preference is not like that. "Do not offer me this tool" is a sentence about
the *next* request, and reading it once at startup makes it a sentence about the
next restart -- so a switch on the page changed a file and nothing else, and the
only way to be believed was to quit. This module is the small amount of
machinery that closes that gap, and it is deliberately the only thing in it:

- **one file, compared by content.** A parse happens only when the bytes
  actually changed. Every writer is covered by construction, because what is
  watched is the file rather than any particular writer -- the page, the TUI,
  another process, a hand edit.
- **failures keep the last good answer.** A config being rewritten is briefly
  unparseable, and a torn read must not empty the answer: withholding every tool
  for one turn because a file was mid-write is worse than answering with the
  value from a second ago.

What must NOT be read through here: anything whose change implies work rather
than a different answer. Constructing a provider imports litellm (seconds),
connecting an MCP server touches the network, and moving the workspace root
mid-turn changes what a path means halfway through a tool call. Those keep their
explicit apply paths (``apply_mcp_config``, ``apply_agents``) where the cost is
visible at the call site.
