    omitting the ``subagent`` argument is an agent the model cannot be told about.

    A row here is an *override* of the package's own seed rows (see
    ``raven.agent.subagent.builtin_agents``), matched by ``name`` -- writing one
    is how a user retunes ``research-raven``'s skills, and writing a name the

    ``merge_builtin_seeds`` discards it. An unnamed ``spawn`` and a dag node with
    no ``subagent`` both dispatch to the generic seed, so a roster without it is a
    roster with a hole where the default lands.

    means the full catalogue, an empty list means *no* menu at all, and a list
