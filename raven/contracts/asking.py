"""The asking papers: turn-scoped capabilities a host lends the tools.

A tool that has to put a question to the user, ask approval for one exact
command, or hand a prompt to whoever is driving the session, types against one
of these shapes. The concrete brokers live with the transport that constructs
them (the RPC surface, the gateway's channels, the ACP host) and are injected
at assembly; nothing here imports a machine.

The host side of the same seam is here too: what a tool exposes for an entrance
to lend it a capability for one turn (``SupportsDirectAsk``; approval binds the
turn-scoped permission context instead of any tool). An entrance probes for
that shape, never for the class
-- a shelf may seat another Tool implementation, and the entrance must not care.
