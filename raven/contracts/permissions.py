"""The permission papers: what the gate may say about one tool call.

The gate (``raven.permissions``) decides before dispatch; these are the only
shapes it is allowed to answer with, and the only shapes an approval transport
is allowed to answer a human's click with. Contracts only -- nothing here
imports the gate, a broker, or a tool.

``Deny`` names its source because the refusals are acted on: a user rule is the
reader's own config to edit, a builtin refusal is not. ``NeedsApproval`` is a
declaration, not an interaction -- whether anyone can actually be asked belongs
to the turn, and an unattended turn upgrades it to ``Deny`` where the gate runs.
