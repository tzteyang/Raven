"""Persistence: PlaybookSpec <-> one ``playbook.md`` per directory.

Layout, per the agreed field definition:

    <root>/<name>/playbook.md        # one directory, one file, nothing else

``playbook.md`` has three regions: a two-field frontmatter (name /
description — all an index needs), a human-readable body the machine never
parses, and one fenced ``yaml playbook-spec`` block holding every machine
field. Being under the scan root *is* the discriminator — no marker fields,
no sidecar. A generator's open questions and assumptions go into the body
(the ``## Open questions`` section) for a human to read; whether the
playbook is matchable on this machine lives in config
(``playbooks.disabled``), never in the file — the file is the distribution
unit.

The library is two such roots layered: the builtin root ships inside the
package (read-only by construction — no write path targets it), the user
root lives under agent home and is where every save lands. A user directory
with a builtin's name shadows the builtin: same command surface, the user's
file wins, and the load path says so once per shadowed name.

    Two changes landed together that a stored file cannot survive untouched, and
    both are invisible failures rather than loud ones -- the runtime catches a
    load error as a warning and drops the playbook out of the library, so a user's
    saved procedure simply stops existing.

    The step's target field is ``subagent``; a stored file spells it ``agent``.
    That one is unconditional and not tied to any marker, because *every*
    playbook ever written spells it that way -- the field was ``agent`` on the
    playbook side long before the two node definitions merged, so its presence
    dates nothing. Rewritten only when the file does not already carry
    ``subagent``, so a hand-edited file holding both is left for the node model
    to reject rather than silently half-honoured.

    ``confirm`` on a node is gone (the gate is graph-level), and the node model
    forbids unknown keys. Every playbook the previous release saved carries it:
    ``block_dump`` is ``exclude_none``, not ``exclude_defaults``, so ``False`` was
    written out in full.

    A step naming one of the four retired built-in agents is repointed at
    ``raven``. Those four were labels on one shared in-process loop -- same
    provider, same model, same tools, same system prompt -- so this rewrite
    changes a stored playbook's target name and nothing about what runs it. Left
    alone the step would fail validation ("agent not in the registry") and take
    the whole playbook out of the library, which is the invisible failure this
    function exists to prevent.

    ``skills: []`` / ``mcps: []`` used to mean "everything" -- the executor folded
    an empty list to ``None`` -- and now mean "nothing at all". Left alone, such a
    file would load and then run every step with an empty skill menu, which is the
    quieter of the two failures and the worse one.

    A node-level ``confirm`` key is the marker for "written by that release", and
    it is a sound one-way signal: the old writer always emitted it, so its
    presence dates the file, while a file without it is read on today's terms.
    That is why the empty-list rewrite is scoped to nodes carrying it rather than
    applied everywhere -- on a current file ``skills: []`` is a deliberate
    instruction, and rewriting it would silently widen what that step may reach.

    ``taskSummary`` is required now, and a stored playbook written before it
    existed does not carry it; such a file loads with its summary taken from
    ``description``, which every frontmatter carries. Left alone, the missing
    key would fail validation and the playbook would vanish from the library
    -- the same invisible failure as the rewrites above.
