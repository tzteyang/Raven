description: push a project forward one round at a time, with a planner, a builder and a verifier
---

A planner, a builder and a verifier, pushing one project forward a round at
a time. Ships with Raven: say "run rounds" in the project -- the keywords below
are what brings it to mind, and the name is what runs it -- or
`raven playbook run long-horizon-dev-stint` from it.

What it needs from the project, and what happens when it is not there:

* a git repository. What a role writes outside its own paths is undone by
  putting the tree back, and there is nothing to put back without one, so a
  directory that is not a repository is refused rather than run unguarded;
* `.stint/` -- the standing orders each role reads (`planner.md`,
  `builder.md`, `verifier.md`), the specification they plan from, and the backlog
  they move work through. **Laid out for you** when it is missing, before the
  run is put to you for approval.

The standing orders are referenced rather than pasted (`{{ref:...}}`): a round
that inlined every rule into every prompt is how the reply ceiling was reached
the first time.

Where it works: this repository, on a branch of its own (`stint/<id>`), which is
the default `isolation`. The tree is the run's until it ends and your own branch
is left where it is; `git log stint/<id>` is where the work lands. A project that
would rather keep its checkout usable meanwhile adds `isolation: worktree`, and
pays a second copy of the repository for it.

What it does *not* carry, and why: no role runs in a tree of its own (the run has
one and the roles share it), and there is one builder rather than three.

# Declared by what it proves, not by a command: this file travels, and the
# command that builds a Godot project is nothing on a Node one. The project
# answers once -- `raven playbook stint check set long-horizon-dev-stint build --run "..."`
# -- and the answer is kept in `.stint/checks.json`. A project the tree plainly
# affords a build for is answered for you; a fresh one is asked before the run.

# Every role below mirrors the frontmatter of the guard file it reads. Those
# files carry their own owns/appends/reads, so declaring something different
# here would give each role two rosters -- the one it is told and the one it is
# judged by. .stint/backlog.json and .stint/HUMAN_DECISIONS.md are artifacts
# rather than anyone's: a role reaches them through `raven playbook stint task` and
# `raven playbook stint ask`, and grading them by path would undo every legal move.

      Assign what this round should do with `raven playbook stint task assign --role
      planner`, and write the brief to the report path named below as yours.

      # Builder that put its checks under `tools/` where its orders said it
      # could had them undone as a stray write.

      Move each task you finish with `raven playbook stint task implement <id> --role

      {{round.verify}}

      Give a verdict per task in review with `raven playbook stint task verdict <id>
      --role verifier --proven --evidence <path>` or `--not-proven --reason "..."`. A
      verdict with no evidence behind it is an opinion, not a verdict.
