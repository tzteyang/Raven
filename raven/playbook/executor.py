"""PlaybookExecutor — from a matched spec plus extracted params to a running
graph.

``dag`` mode ends at the same dispatch a model-composed graph goes through: the
filled node list handed to ``SubAgentDagTool.execute`` -- same validation, same
scheduler, same billing, same re-injection.

``prompt`` mode has two answers depending on who is asking, and that is the point
of the mode rather than a wart. In a conversation the caller *is* a model, so the
filled guidance is returned to it and it composes the graph itself, with the whole
conversation in hand and ordinary tool errors to correct against. On the CLI there
is no model in the room, so ``_compose`` spends one call to turn the guidance into
a graph. Deleting that path would have quietly removed the CLI's ability to run a
prompt-mode playbook at all.

This module builds no backends and resolves no agent names: each node names an
agent on the shared table and the graph tool resolves it.

Stateless by design: a plan either runs, or comes back as questions the
caller relays to the user, and the caller decides what to do with the answer --
it holds the conversation and calls again. Nothing here waits, which is what
lets this ship without a confirm-state machine. (It used to say the next
message re-entered matching: there is no matching left to re-enter. The passive
funnel that judged one message before the turn is gone, and trigger words now
decide which playbooks get *described* to the model, never which one runs.)

        Nothing here resolves an agent name or builds a backend any more. Each
        node carries the agent it wants, the graph tool looks it up on the shared
        table, and a playbook step is dispatched by exactly the code path a
        model-composed node is. What that removed: a per-node backend built here, a
        hardcoded ``stateful=False`` that contradicted the mechanism, and the
        synthetic ``pb-<node>`` agent name every step ran under -- which is why a
        playbook's steps were unattributable in a trace and why an ``instance``
        could not work.

        ``values`` is here for the ``mcpServers`` section only: the spec's own
        server definitions reference secret params, so they can only be filled
        once the params are resolved, and the resolution happens in
        :meth:`execute`. They travel to the graph tool as a run-scoped overlay
        rather than being merged into the host's configuration -- see
        ``raven.agent.subagent.dag_mcp_scope``. Without this hand-off a
        conversation running the same playbook resolved every server it shipped
        to ``not_configured``, while ``raven playbook run`` resolved them fine,
        because only the CLI wired a source that had heard of them.

        **The hand-off is only reachable from here**, which is why a prompt-mode
        playbook may not carry the section at all: in a conversation
        :meth:`execute` returns guidance and the model dispatches the graph in a
        later turn, through a public tool with no such parameter and no scope
        left to read. ``validate._prompt_mode_cannot_carry_servers`` refuses that
        combination when the file is validated, rather than letting it load and
        drop the definitions here.
