"""The playbook contract, per the agreed field definition (playbook.md, three
regions: a two-field frontmatter, a human-readable body, one fenced
``yaml playbook-spec`` block holding every machine field).

Naming: python attributes are snake_case; the on-disk block is camelCase
(``promptTemplate`` / ``dependsOn``), handled by field aliases — dump with
``by_alias=True`` to get the wire shape.

Every field is a contract field: exactly what the field definition allows
inside ``playbook.md``. There is no lifecycle state here — a generator's
assumptions and open questions go into the human body (the
``## Open questions`` section), and whether a playbook is matchable on this
machine lives in config (``playbooks.disabled``), because the file is the
distribution unit and local state must not travel with it.

The two modes differ only in where the graph comes from: ``dag`` ships it in
``nodes``; ``prompt`` ships assembly guidance in ``prompts`` and a model
composes a graph at run time, which must pass the same validation before the
same execution chain runs it.
