        the caller's -- a ``dag`` playbook dispatches (after any gaps are filled
        and the graph-level confirm passes: ``PlaybookSpec.confirm``, dispatched
        as ``SubAgentDagSpec.confirm``), a ``prompt`` one comes back as composition
        guidance for the caller to build a graph from. The caller does not choose,
        and is not told to: ``mode`` is how the author wrote the file, not a
        decision anyone downstream should be making.

        ``allow_disabled`` is for the CLI, where the user named the playbook
        themselves. ``max_rounds`` is for the caller who was told how long to
        keep going; it means something only to a ``rounds`` playbook.

        ``confirmed`` is relayed to the executor, whose gate reads it as "this
        caller already put the run to the user". Passed through rather than
        decided here: which entries ask is a property of the entry, and the
        runtime is shared by all of them.
