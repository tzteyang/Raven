"""The agent-playbook contract: one file, one turn's worth of workers.

A third ``mode`` beside the graph-shaped two. ``dag`` and ``prompt`` answer
"how is this piece of work done"; ``agent`` answers "who is doing it, and with
what brief". There is deliberately no graph: which worker runs when stays with
the main agent at run time, which is the one party that has read the files and
run the searches by the time it matters.

Shape, and why it is this small:

- ``coordinator`` is the main Raven's durable operating charter. It owns the
  user conversation and decides when to answer directly or delegate.
- ``delegate`` is the only field with behaviour. Each entry is a label, the
  roster agent behind it, and a sub-playbook that becomes that label's charter.
- ``version`` / ``mode`` / ``name`` / ``description`` carry nothing this
  version reads. They are the file's identity once a playbook is stored, and a
  schema that gains them later has to answer for every row written without
  them, so they are written from the start.
- No ``mode`` / ``model`` on a delegate row. Both would let a generated file
  overrule the operator: ``SubagentManager.resolve_mode`` states that a
  sub-agent's effort is the operator's setting and that the model composing a
  dispatch is the one party that cannot know what was chosen. A model-authored
  playbook is exactly that party.

The sub-playbook mirrors the four module roles, but this version renders it to
text rather than binding it: the charter reaches the worker as a preamble on
its task. So ``tools`` here reads as "these are the tools for this job", not as
a permission -- narrowing what a model is *shown* has never been a permission
in Raven, and the enforcement point is ``ToolRegistry.execute``.

    - it runs in the **worker's** process, on the worker's own calls, so it
