"""Turning a stint playbook into one graph per round, for as many rounds as it takes.

The whole of what ``mode: stint`` adds, and it adds no execution layer: a round
is compiled into an ordinary sub-agent graph and submitted through the ordinary
entry, so validation, quota, scheduling, the five backends and the result path
are the ones that were already there. What is new is only the loop around them,
and the loop is a file plus a callback.

Where each piece runs:

* **start** is on the turn that loaded the playbook. It writes the stint, compiles
  round one and submits it, and returns a receipt immediately -- nothing waits.
* **advance** is on the finishing run's own task, with no turn anywhere. It reads
  what the round left, decides whether another is worth opening, and either
  submits the next one and says nothing, or returns the stint's whole result to
  be announced once.

The driver holds no stint in memory between those two. Everything needed to
compile round twelve is in the stint file, which is what lets a stint outlive the
process that started it.

The main agent is present at both ends and absent in between, which is the
point: a run that takes hours should not hold a conversation open.

        """Give a stint more rounds than it was started with, and open one if it is over.

        The budget is the one thing about a stint a person routinely judges wrong,
        and they find out only once it is spent: five rounds of good work end on
        ``the round budget of 5 is spent``, and what is wanted next is a sixth.

        Without this there was nothing that gave them one. ``resume`` takes up a
        round that was interrupted and a stint that ran its budget out has none,
        so the only move left was to start a second stint -- which cuts its
        worktree from the project's HEAD, and the first stint's work is on a
        branch nobody merged. That starts again from before the first commit,
        and says nothing about having done so. "Three more rounds" does not mean
        that.

        Raising the budget on a stint still going is the same verb and costs
        nothing extra: no round is opened, because one is already in flight and
        ``advance`` reads the budget from the file when it lands.

        The round opens without asking again. The one approval a stint gets named
        a round count, and this is a person changing that count deliberately --
        asking them to approve what they just typed is not a second opinion.
