"""The sections a ``mode: stint`` playbook carries beyond the common ones.

One round is one pass of every role over the project; the playbook says who the
roles are, what carries between rounds, what counts as passing, and when to
stop. It does not say what happens in a round -- that is the roles' own
business, and a file that tried to say it would be a program.

``roles[]`` is a ``delegate[]`` row with the round's fields on it, deliberately:
a worker is a worker whether one turn dispatches it or thirty rounds do, and
one description of a worker is what keeps the two from drifting. The extra
fields are on the subclass rather than on :class:`DelegateEntry` itself,
because a delegate table is *generated* every turn when that harness is on, and
a field on the parent is a field a model could emit -- which is how an
operator's own settings get overruled by a file the operator never wrote.

What is *not* here, and where it went instead:

* **model** -- on the roster row ``name`` points at. A playbook is a file that
  travels, and letting a travelling file pick the model overrules the person
  running it. Three roles on three models is three roster rows.
* **workspace** -- not per role. A whole run works one tree, and the tree is
  the stint's own worktree so the session that started it keeps its checkout.
