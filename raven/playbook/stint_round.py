"""What a stint does to one round of its own graph: measure, undo, hand back.

The three layers of a boundary all live here, and they are three because one
is not enough:

* the role is **told** what it owns, which the compiler does;
* what it wrote is **measured** against that when it stops, and what it had no
  claim to is put back -- here;
* its own checks are **run**, and a failure it can fix is handed straight back
  to it rather than to a person -- also here.

There is no layer that refuses a write before it lands. A charter narrows a
role's tools only where the playbook declares one, ``owns`` is not turned into a
charter, and a role that shells out would go around a tool gate anyway -- which
is why the measuring pass is the boundary rather than a backstop to one.

Everything in this module runs on the graph runner's own hooks, inside the round,
with no turn and nobody watching. That shapes two decisions:

* a check failure the role can act on becomes a **follow-up**, not a question --
  there is nobody to ask, and "the build failed, here is the error" is already a
  complete instruction;
* once the handback budget is spent, the round **moves on with the failure
  recorded**. It does not fail the node: a failed node cascades a skip through
  everything downstream, so a builder who could not make the build pass would
  take the reviewer down with it, and a round that ends with a known defect
  written down is worth more than a round that ends with nothing.

        arrives from a terminal or an RPC while the roles are running and writes

        status it was opened with, so the stop was read as `running` at the
        hand-over and another round opened -- the person's instruction lost
        without a word.
