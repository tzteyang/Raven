"""The scent menu — pull-mode skill discovery's per-turn hint.

Replaces the push pipeline's per-turn LLM work (rewriter + gate) with rules
and a cheap lookup: on a *fat* turn, one ``router.select`` over the same
three sources renders a few name+description lines into the turn's user
envelope. No bodies, no system-prefix bytes, no LLM calls. The model pulls
what it wants through ``find_skill`` / ``read_skill``.

Judgement errors are engineered to be near-free in both directions: a turn
wrongly judged fat costs one sub-millisecond local lookup (plus one light
Hub query when wired); a turn wrongly judged lean costs only that turn's
menu, with ``find_skill`` as the backstop. (The menu is stripped from the
persisted session together with the runtime-context block, so it never
carries over between turns.) That asymmetry is why the classifier below is
a handful of rules and not a model.
