"""Segment 5 — ``# Skills``. EverOS: rewriter → router → gate → render.

Five-step pipeline:

1. **Rewriter** (optional) — one LLM call that judges ``need_retrieval``
   and rewrites the query for skill routing. ``need_retrieval=False``
   short-circuits the rest of the build to an empty segment.
2. **Router fan-out** — :class:`SkillForgeRouter` queries Local + Hub +
   Everos in parallel and RRF-fuses to ``pool_size``.
3. **Pre-gate body hydrate** — Hub hits arrive with ``content=""``
   (catalog metadata only). Parallel ``SkillHubClient.get(id)`` fills
   ``content`` so the gate can see real body excerpts. Local/Everos hits
   already carry body and are untouched.
4. **LLM gate** (optional) — one LLM call that picks 0..``max_select``
   hits from the pool. Empty result is a valid "inject nothing".
5. **Post-gate refs hydrate** — for the 0-2 selected hits, resolve
   ``{baseDir}/x`` + markdown link refs to absolute paths. Hub hits
   download + extract the zip first (via ``SkillHubClient.install`` with
   ``prefetched_meta`` from step 3 to skip the redundant ``get``).

When rewriter / gate are not wired (provider missing, config off, etc.)
the pipeline degrades gracefully — both are independent and the segment
still produces a valid result with whatever is wired.
