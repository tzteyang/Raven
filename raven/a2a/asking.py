"""The A2A transport's question broker.

``QuestionResponder`` is structural, and each transport brings its own: the TUI
has one, the gateway has one, this is A2A's. Nothing in ``AskUserTool`` changes.

The turn is never suspended. It awaits a future here while its task is reported
as ``INPUT_REQUIRED``, and a later ``SendMessage`` against the same task id
resolves that future -- so what looks like resuming a task is answering a turn
that never stopped running.
