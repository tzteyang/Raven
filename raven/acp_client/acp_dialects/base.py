"""Reading an ACP tool call the way the spec describes it.

An ACP adapter reports a tool call twice over: once machine-readably, in
``kind`` (one of ten spec values) and ``locations``, and once for a human, in
``title``. Only the first is comparable across adapters -- measured, the same
``kind: "execute"`` arrives titled ``"Terminal"`` from claude-agent-acp and
titled with the entire shell command from codex-acp -- so the ``kind`` is what
this reports and the title is kept only as the fallback for a call that carries
no argument at all.

What it reports is the transport's own name for the call, at the finest grain
the transport gives. Naming it in raven's vocabulary is the read boundary's job
(:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.tool_vocabulary`): presentation is recoverable from
provenance and provenance is not recoverable from presentation, so a record that
renamed the call could never be read back for what the agent actually ran.
Handing a renderer the adapter's *title* instead is the one thing that is not on
the table -- it put a 100-character pipeline where a verb belongs.

Adapters that answer differently from the spec subclass this; see
:mod:`raven.acp_client.acp_dialects.claude_code` and
:mod:`raven.acp_client.acp_dialects.codex`. Anything not measured is left to
this class rather than guessed at per adapter.
