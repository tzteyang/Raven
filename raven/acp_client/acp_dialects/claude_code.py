"""claude-agent-acp: a precise tool name, and a result sent twice.

Three things this adapter does that the spec does not describe:

- It names the tool it actually ran in ``_meta.claudeCode.toolName`` (``Bash``,
  ``Read``, ...). That is finer than ``kind``, which cannot tell ``Glob`` from
  ``Grep`` -- both are ``kind: "search"``.
- It sends the same output twice: ``rawOutput`` carries the text, and
  ``content`` carries that same text wrapped in a markdown fence. The fence is
  for a client that renders markdown; a transcript row is not one, and the
  literal ```` ```console ```` was appearing in the rendered output.
- It never emits a ``tool_call`` for ``TodoWrite`` or the Task tools. Their
  state goes to a ``sessionUpdate: "plan"`` frame instead, so the plan row is
  the only place they appear, and it is named for the tool that produced it.

``Bash`` and ``Read`` are the two names measured on the wire (v0.66.0; ``Bash``
again with the same meta, ``rawOutput`` and fence on v0.79.0, 2026-09-21), and
any other name is reported exactly as sent rather than checked against a list: the
record keeps the transport's own vocabulary, so a tool this adapter adds or
renames upstream is recorded for what it is without an entry anywhere.
Those names now reach a client unchanged: the read boundary renames only the
ACP spec kinds, so a claude_code row is rendered under Claude Code's own
vocabulary.

        Asked separately they are two prompts for what the user experiences as one
        question -- and the clarify sheet already offers exactly this shape.

        Which sibling belongs to which question is read from the adapter's own
        marker where it is stamped, and only from the `<name>_custom` spelling
        where nothing in the request is marked. The spelling alone also matches an
        independent free-text property that merely shares a prefix, and folding
        that one loses a question the schema did ask: it is never put to the user,
        and its answer surfaces only if the enum half happens to be answered
        off-enum. Against a marked request an unmarked lookalike is the adapter
        saying it is not a pair, which is worth more than the guess.
