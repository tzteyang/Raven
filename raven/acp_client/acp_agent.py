"""Third-party ACP agent backend: one ``session/prompt`` on a pooled connection.

The counterpart of :mod:`raven.agent.subagent.backends.cli_agent`. Where that one
spawns a process per task and parses whatever the CLI prints, this one keeps a
connection (owned by :mod:`raven.acp_client.pool`) and delivers the task as a
request on it.

Two consequences worth stating, because they are what the transport buys:

- The agent's intermediate work arrives as ``session/update`` notifications while
  the task runs, instead of being reconstructed from stdout afterwards. It is
  recorded on this backend's own tracing span and in the run's own activity
  record (:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.activity`) rather than returned, so neither
  ``spawn`` nor ``run_subagent_dag`` has to change to carry it.
- Those notifications are the run as a reader wants it, not everything that
  crossed the wire. The whole exchange -- the agent's own requests and what raven
  answered, raven's outbound frames, notifications no session was listening for,
  stderr -- is written by :mod:`raven.acp_client.journal` for the life of the
  connection, and each call records the byte range it occupied there.
- Resuming is the agent's own ``session/load``, not a second command template, so
  whether an agent *can* resume is read from its handshake instead of inferred
  from a config field a human filled in.

        Two unrelated peers earn it, and the two reasons are worth keeping apart.

        **The agent is configured as not isolating** (``sessionMcp: false``).
        Nothing in ``initialize`` reports isolation -- the three shipped adapters
        report the same ``mcpCapabilities`` and only one of them fails to isolate
        -- so this is a declaration on the agent row and not something to probe;
        see ``ThirdPartyAcpSubagentConfig.session_mcp``. It matters because raven
        pools one connection per agent name: on a peer that does not isolate, two
        concurrent sub-agents see each other's servers, so a node deliberately not
        granted one reaches it through the sibling that was.

        **The peer is a raven build that would refuse the field**, answering a
        non-empty ``mcpServers`` with ``-32602`` instead of connecting it. Such a
        build reports the same ``mcpCapabilities`` object as one that honours the
        field, so the only signal is the absence of the ``_meta`` promise
        (``SESSION_MCP_CAPABILITY``) -- read from the snapshot the way
        ``is_stateful`` and ``can_steer`` are, because the decision has to be made
        before any endpoint is opened.

        Absence of the promise is *not* read as a refusal on its own, and this is
        the load-bearing half: stdio servers are the ACP baseline, so
        claude-agent-acp, codex-acp and opencode all accept a bridge stanza while
        declaring nothing, and per-session lifetime for them is the host socket's
        lifetime rather than anything they agreed to. Requiring the promise from
        them would turn their MCP off. So the peer must also identify as a raven,
        by the same ``agentInfo.name`` substring test ``dialect_for`` uses --
        measured: ``raven``, ``raven-ppt`` and ``raven-x-research`` against
        ``@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp``, ``@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp``
        and ``OpenCode``.

        An unmeasured agent has no snapshot and is therefore never refused by the
        second branch, which leaves the pre-existing ``-32602`` as its failure and
        never silences a peer that would have worked.

        That second branch is transitional by intent: every raven fork is meant to
        serve per-session MCP, so it exists for the window in which a fork has not
        taken the code yet, not as a standing policy about forks. The first is not

        On every route into a session, for the reason ``_set_mode`` gives below
        and for the same mechanism: the agent binds the choice to the session id
        it holds in memory, so it survives an engine eviction but not a restart
        of the agent process, and the pool relaunches that process whenever the
        launch key changes. Re-asserting each time is what repairs that without
        anyone noticing.

        The channel is ``session/set_config_option`` with ``configId: "model"``.
        ``session/set_model`` is not in the stable schema, and an agent waiting
        for it would never be asked to switch.

        A cleared override is a request too, and that is the half worth spelling
        out. The option takes a value and has no "unset", so dropping the host's
        record restores nothing: the session keeps answering on whatever it was
        last told, while every surface reports the agent's own. The way back is
        to send the session's own baseline again -- the value it reported before
        this host first moved it -- and only when this host did move it, so an
        untouched session still costs no frame at all.

        Never fatal, like the mode beside it. An agent that offers no such option
        answers invalid-params and one that will not take the value answers with
        its own code; either way the task still runs on the agent's own model,
        and failing the run would be a worse outcome than running it on a model
        the caller did not pick. Said once per value: the push is re-asserted
        on every route in and on every session a spawn opens, so a permanent

        NOT a restart of the agent process -- and the pool relaunches that process
