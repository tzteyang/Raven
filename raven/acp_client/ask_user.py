"""An ACP sub-agent's `ask_user`, when it asks outside `elicitation/create`.

Raven-X routes its deep-research clarify through an extension of its own rather
than the spec method: the question leaves as a `session/update` whose
`sessionUpdate` is `ask_user_request`, and the answer goes back as a
`_raven/clarify_respond` request. That agent arms the route only when the client
declared `_meta.raven.askUser` at `initialize`, which is what
`CLIENT_CAPABILITIES` now carries -- unarmed, its tool falls back to ending the
turn on the questions, so this module is the difference between a clarify that
interrupts one turn and one that costs a whole round trip through the caller.

Separate from `elicitor.py` because the two shapes have nothing in common: a
notification out and a request back, against a request answered by its result.
What they do share is the far end -- the same `clarify.request` contract, and the
same per-conversation lock, because both reach one question broker that allows a
single pending question per conversation.

**Every question a run owns is answered, including the ones nobody can put to a
user.** The agent blocks its tool call on the reply for ten minutes before
falling back to the question's default, so silence here is not a no-op: it is
the stall the capability exists to avoid. A background turn and a finished run
both answer with an empty string, which the asking side already reads as "the
user did not answer; proceed with best judgment". A session nobody owns is the
one case that is routed and not answered -- raven cannot answer for a run that
is gone, and the agent falls back to its own timeout (see
`_SessionResponders.dispatch`). The window is a frame landing after the
backend's ``finally`` has detached the responder.
