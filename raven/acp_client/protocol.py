"""Wire framing and error types for ACP over stdio.

Framing is newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0: one complete JSON object per line, in
both directions. Verified against a real ``hermes acp`` server, which answers a
single-line ``initialize`` request with a single-line result.

The error types exist so callers can tell apart failures that mean different
things. A remote error is the agent saying no; a protocol error is the agent
saying something raven cannot parse; a connection error is the agent not being
there at all. Registration reports these as ``needs_auth`` / ``unreachable``
differently, and a dispatch retries none of them the same way.

# -- the extensions a raven serves over ACP -----------------------------------
#
# Schema 1.20.0 has no steering method: a prompt is the only way text reaches an
# agent, and two prompts on one session are refused because ``session/update``
# carries no request correlation. So mid-turn steering has to be an extension,
# and the schema's own convention for one is an underscore-prefixed method name
# -- the single namespace a conformant client will not mistake for a standard
# method it should have implemented.
#
# Paired: the method is announced in ``agentCapabilities._meta`` under
# ``STEER_CAPABILITY`` and is invisible to a client that did not read the
# declaration, which is the point. Both directions live here -- the agent
# direction serves the method, the client direction calls it -- so a typo cannot
# make one side silently disagree with the other.
STEER_METHOD = "_raven/session/steer"
STEER_CAPABILITY = "raven.steer"

# The other one, and a promise rather than a feature flag: a raven that declares
# this says that ``mcpServers`` on ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` /
# ``session/resume`` is really connected, and that the tools behind it are
# visible to that session's turns alone -- neither the definitions nor the tools
# outlive the session, and no sibling session on the same connection can reach
# them.
#
# It has to be an extension because the spec has no field for either half.
# stdio servers are the ACP baseline, so accepting them is not advertisable at
# all, and ``mcpCapabilities`` carries nothing about isolation -- measured,
# claude-agent-acp and opencode report the same ``{http, sse}`` object while only
# claude isolates. So a raven that answers the field with ``-32602`` is
# indistinguishable on the wire from one that honours it, and that gap is the
# only thing this closes. It is not a gate on handing any agent a bridge: a
# bridge stanza is an ordinary stdio server, and its per-session lifetime is the
# host's socket lifetime, which needs no agreement from the far side.
