"""The turn's route to a human, for code with no tool registry to look in.

`AskUserTool` is registered per `AgentLoop`, and an ACP backend is built from
config with no loop reference, so it cannot resolve the tool the way
`AgentLoop._confirm_graph` does. A turn-scoped ContextVar is how `ExecTool`
already solves the same problem for shell approvals, and it inherits into the
background task a sub-agent run happens on.

Both `current_ask` and `current_autofill` must be read at construction in the
turn's context: the connection pool carries the ContextVars of whichever turn
first opened it, so question-time reads return the wrong turn's objects.
