"""Post-import phases: mirror the profile and install the skills, per platform.

EverOS storage alone does not reach every consumer. Curator, Personalizer and
the Sentinel producers read ``user_memory/profile/user.md`` directly, and the
skill pool is a directory tree, so both are landed by the importer itself once
the message pass is over. Each platform contributes what it has: Hermes its
``USER.md`` entries and its skills tree, Claude Code the memory files it marks
as being about the user (``metadata.type`` of ``user`` or ``feedback``) and
the skills under ``~/.claude/skills``.

Both phases are additive and run after the message pass, so a failure in
either is reported without reversing an import that has already landed. The
caller decides whether they run at all: a cancelled run must stop, not hand
over its two longest steps.
