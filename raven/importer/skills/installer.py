"""Filter, copy and account for imported skills.

Only ``bundled_pristine`` is skipped. The two error costs are asymmetric:
importing too much leaves a few unused entries in a pool that injects at most
two skills per turn by relevance, and every one of them sits under a single
directory the user can delete; importing too little is silent, and the user
has no way to learn what was left behind.

The category level Hermes uses for browsing is dropped and a single
``hermes/`` level interposed, because Raven's registry reads the first
directory level below a layer root as the skill's source label -- mounting
the tree as-is would mint one bogus source per category.

``SkillImportSummary`` keeps ``pristine`` separate from ``skipped`` so the
counts add up to ``total`` and so the CLI can tell the user which of the two
happened: factory content left alone is the normal case and says nothing is
wrong, while a per-instance skip means a name was taken or the skill had
already been imported.
