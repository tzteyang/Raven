"""Land Hermes USER.md entries into the native user profile file.

EverOS is not enough on its own: six host consumers read
``user_memory/profile/user.md`` directly (Curator, Personalizer, and four
Sentinel producers), and the Sentinel daily plan takes that file as its entire
input. Content that only reaches EverOS is invisible to all of them.

Each entry is classified to one H2 section because injection picks whole
sections -- ``MemoryStore.get_memory_context`` keeps the top-2 by lexical
overlap -- so which section an entry lands in is what determines whether a
later turn ever sees it. In practice the classifier is biased toward the
handful of headings the seeded USER.md template already ships (e.g.
``## Preferences``), so most entries append into an existing section's body
rather than minting a new one; a new heading is created only when nothing
already on file fits.

The LLM only picks a heading; the entry text is written verbatim. On any
failure -- a raised exception, a provider-returned error response, or an
illegal heading -- the entry lands under ``## Notes``, which injection always
includes, so a misclassification costs tokens, never visibility.

    their target section.

    Entry text is written unchanged apart from surrounding whitespace; blank
    entries carry nothing to import and are dropped (and are not counted as
    skipped).

    Idempotency is keyed on the entry's own text against its *target
    section's* body, not the heading and not the whole file: a heading
    collision is a routine outcome (several facts can legitimately share a
    section, and the seeded USER.md template already ships headings like
    "## Preferences"), so treating "heading already exists" as "already
    imported" would silently drop content on the common cold-start path.

    distinct entry that happens to be a substring of unrelated text
    elsewhere in the profile.

    content, so every heading is picked before the write lock is taken --
