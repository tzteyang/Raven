"""ask_user tool — pause the turn to ask the user a question and await the reply.

Blocking interaction: the registry does NOT wrap this in a timeout (the
injected responder manages its own fail-safe). On execute the tool hands the turn's
conversation_id and the prompt to the broker, which emits a ``clarify.request``
notification and blocks until an inbound answer arrives (or the broker's
fail-safe default fires). The returned answer is rendered as a natural-language
tool result; the loop never sees an exception.

A batch shares one deadline rather than one per question, and a call whose
shape would waste the user's time -- a single-option question, a repeated
question, more questions than the cap -- is rejected before anything is
rendered, with a message that steers the next attempt.

``execute`` is serialized against an ACP-relayed sub-agent's own ``ask_user``
round trip via ``question_lock`` (shared with ``raven.acp_client.ask_user`` /
``elicitor``): both routes reach the same broker slot for one conversation_id,
and without the same lock the later of the two forces the earlier one's pending
future to its default -- indistinguishable, downstream, from a genuine timeout.
``ask_direct`` deliberately does not take it: the relayed routes call it while
already holding that lock across their whole exchange, and the lock is not
re-entrant, so taking it here again would wait the whole budget out and answer
empty on every relayed question. Its callers own the serialization.
