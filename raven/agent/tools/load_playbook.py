"""``load_playbook`` — the one way into the stored playbook library.

The model decides whether a playbook applies, from this tool's description, the
same way it decides between ``spawn`` and ``run_subagent_dag``. That is a change:
a passive matcher used to decide before the turn began, on one message with no
conversation history, and a hit took the turn over. The decision now sits with
the party that has the context.

**Loading is one action; what it leads to is the playbook's business.** A ``dag``
Workflow dispatches from inside this call -- the caller never gets a chance to
"load and then not run", and never sees the graph it would otherwise be tempted
to edit. A Harness-only artifact activates its reusable workers for the rest of
the turn. A legacy ``prompt`` playbook still comes back as composition guidance.
Which of those happens is deliberately absent from this tool's signature: it is
the stored artifact's concern, not something the caller should classify before
it can ask.

What the caller may supply is bounded to two arguments -- ``params`` (declared
values) and ``fills`` (fields the author left blank) -- and ``fills`` is refused
for any field the playbook already wrote. So "use this playbook, but change step
3" cannot be expressed, which is the point: the file in git stays an accurate
description of what ran.
