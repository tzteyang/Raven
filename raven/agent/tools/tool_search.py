"""Progressive tool disclosure for large catalogs.

When built-ins + plugins + MCP push the tool count past a threshold, injecting
every schema into each request burns context that scales with tool count. This
module withholds most schemas and exposes two meta-tools instead:

  - ``tool_search`` — BM25 keyword search over the hidden catalog; each hit
                      carries name + description + parameter schema, enough to
                      call the tool without a second lookup.
  - ``tool_call``   — invoke a cataloged tool by name; forwards through the
                      registry, which validates arguments and returns a
                      correctable error when they don't fit the schema.

The tool list sent to the model never changes turn-to-turn (always the core
set + these two meta-tools), so the prompt cache stays stable across the
whole session — tools sit ahead of system+messages in the cached prefix, so a
changing tool list would invalidate everything after it. The cost is that
cataloged tools are invoked through ``tool_call`` rather than native
function-calling.

Two visibility tiers per turn (see :class:`ToolSearchStrategy`):
  - always-visible: a core set + the meta-tools (full schema every turn);
  - cataloged:      everything else — searchable, schema withheld until asked.

``tool_call`` outlives that feature switch. Progressive disclosure is one reason
a tool's schema may be absent from a request; ``ToolRegistry.hide_from_schema``
is another, and it applies at every catalog size. A schema-hidden tool is
dispatchable — ``ToolRegistry.execute`` never consults the schema — but a model
can only reach it by naming it, and ``tool_call`` is the only place it can. So
the host registers ``tool_call`` unconditionally and gates only ``tool_search``
and the fold on ``tools.tool_search.enabled``.

        the top of every ``before_llm_call``, ahead of any search. Unregistering
