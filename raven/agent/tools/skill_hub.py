"""``read_skill`` / ``use_skill`` — Skill Hub retrieval tools.

Two tools that complete the Skill Hub integration's progressive disclosure
(catalog -> body -> scripts). The discovery half (``HubSkillSource`` injecting
the ``# Skills`` catalog) already lands the candidate list each turn; these
tools are the on-demand fetch the LLM drives after seeing it.

``read_skill`` is the **body** route, for every source. A Hub candidate's
catalog entry is metadata-only; a local skill declaring ``inject: description``
is advertised by its digest entry alone and is excluded from BM25 routing, so
for both the body exists nowhere in context until this tool fetches it. Local
and Everos ids resolve straight from the registry, which is why this tool
registers wherever the registry does and needs no Hub endpoint.

``use_skill`` is **source-agnostic**. The LLM sees one fused, source-tagged
catalog, so it should not reason about provenance — it calls ``use_skill`` with
the qualified id and the tool dispatches on the ``<source>/`` prefix:

- ``local/<name>`` / ``<memory-backend>/<id>`` — already materialized on disk
  (the configured memory backend writes its extracted skills into
  ``<workspace>/skills/<memory-backend>/<id>/``); resolve the skill dir via
  the registry and return its ``scripts/`` path. No download — for these
  sources ``use_skill`` is effectively a no-op resolver.
- ``hub/<slug>`` — download + safely extract the zip into the workspace skill
  tree (so it becomes registry-discoverable), then return the ``scripts/`` path.

Both return a text blob (the ``Tool`` contract is ``-> str``): a markdown header
plus the ``scripts_dir`` line and the SKILL.md body when present.
