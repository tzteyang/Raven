"""Read a finished or in-flight DAG run back out of its run dir and node root.

The live ``dag_*`` progress events are the only thing the web UI sees while a
run executes, and they exist for exactly one page-session: nothing replays them,
and a gateway-mode tool result carries no manifest metadata. The run dir and
flat node root written by :class:`~raven.agent.subagent.dag_store.DagRunStore`
are the durable record, so reading them back is what lets a reloaded page show
the graph again -- and what lets a node's rendered prompt and full output be
shown on demand instead of only the leaf ``terminal_outputs`` the manifest
inlines.

An in-flight run has a ``graph.json`` but no ``manifest.json`` yet (that is
written once, in ``_finalize``), so structure and per-node state are read
separately: structure always from ``graph.json``, state from ``manifest.json``
when it exists and from the caller's overlay (the instance registry) when it
does not.

A replanned run also carries a reserved ``replan`` key there, naming the run that
replaced it; it is not part of ``SubAgentDagSpec`` and must not be, that model being
``extra="forbid"``. Readers here take the keys they want and ignore it.
