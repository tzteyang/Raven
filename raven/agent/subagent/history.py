"""Where a session's sub-agent call history is kept on disk.

Both ways of delegating to a sub-agent record what they were asked and what
they answered, inside that session's metadata directory:

    <agent home>/sessions/<group>/<chat_id>/subagents/
    |-- mas_dag/<run_id>/         what is run-scoped: graph.json, manifest.json
    `-- nodes/<node_id>.*         one task's files, flat across both surfaces

``<group>`` is the project slug on ``raven tui`` / ``raven agent`` and the
channel name on the gateway. Rather than re-derive it, the roots below take
the directory from ``SessionManager.session_dir``, so ``<chat_id>.jsonl`` and
``<chat_id>/`` sit side by side even where the two derivations would disagree
-- a transcript written before project grouping keeps its old group, and only
the session manager knows that.

This is deliberately not inside the session's *working* directory: the history
is an audit trail the agent owns, with the same lifetime as the transcript,
while the working directory holds user artifacts and is configured per channel
(or is a project checkout). ``sessions`` is a protected subtree
(raven/agent/workdir.py), so a working directory can never be aimed at it and
no tool write can reach the history.

A file name is never derived from a sub-agent's output, only from ids raven
mints itself, so nothing here is attacker-controlled.
