"""Built-in third-party subagent presets.

One preset per agent, and each one already carries the transport that agent is
reached over. That choice is made *here*, in the repo, from a measurement -- not
rediscovered on every user's machine at connect time. Whether hermes speaks ACP
is a fact about hermes, and probing for it per install would mean trying a second
transport whose own verification costs the user real tokens (the cli test
dispatches a task) while telling them nothing new.

So connecting is: verify the one path this table names. If it fails, say why
(adapter not installed, gateway not running, not logged in). There is no
fallback to another transport, because a silent fallback would hand the user an
agent with different capabilities than the one they asked for.

Measured on 2026-08-11, which is what fixed each transport below:

- ``Hermes Agent`` - ACP, native (``hermes acp``). resume + fork + load.
- ``Claude Code`` - ACP through the ACP project's adapter. It reads the *local*
  Claude Code credentials: a real prompt failed with exactly the error the local
  ``claude -p`` gives ("Credit balance is too low") while no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY /
  ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN / CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN was set anywhere in the
  environment. That is the property that makes it usable at all: raven treats
  these as *external* agents, so an adapter demanding its own credential would
  not be acceptable.
- ``Codex`` - ACP through the ACP project's adapter. resume + load but **no
  fork**, which is exactly why capabilities are negotiated rather than declared.
- ``OpenCode`` - ACP, native (``opencode acp``). resume + fork + load.
- ``OpenClaw`` - ACP, native (``openclaw acp``). This one is a bridge backed by
  the OpenClaw Gateway rather than a self-contained server: with no reachable
  gateway it never answers ``initialize``, so pass ``--url`` / ``--token`` when
  yours needs them.
- ``MiroThinker`` - not a local agent at all: MiroMind deep-research over an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (set ``apiKey``).

What a row is allowed to fetch depends on what the package is. An **ACP shim** --
a dedicated adapter whose product lives elsewhere, as ``Claude Code`` and
``Codex`` are -- is
plumbing raven brings along: nobody installs one on purpose, it holds no
credential, and there is no local build to defer to, so raven fetches it and
pins the version, because ``npx -y`` would otherwise silently change which shim
build a user runs. The cost is that those need bumping deliberately.

The **agent itself** is never fetched. Its row names the bare executable
(``hermes acp``, ``opencode acp``), so the agent that answers is the one the user
installed, at the version they chose, holding the login they already granted --
and a machine without it says so, because ``_probe_acp`` resolves ``argv[0]`` and
an ``npx`` command always resolves whether the agent is there or not. For a shim
that reaches for a local install the probe therefore asks after that agent as
well (:data:`SHIM_REQUIRED_EXECUTABLES`), so a machine without ``pi`` reads Pi as
absent rather than as connectable. :data:`SHIM_LAUNCHED_PRESETS` is that split,
declared; a test holds every command to it.

Every preset runs unattended, so none of them may stop to ask permission: raven
answers whatever an ACP agent asks (``raven/acp_client/permissions.py``), and the
two adapters that also take a launch-time "never ask" setting are configured with
it below so the question is not asked in the first place. The rest have no such
setting -- checked, not assumed.

The cli transport is not offered by any preset any more, but it is not gone:
entries already configured that way keep working untouched, and a row whose
``kind`` disagrees with its preset's is what the UI reads as "upgradeable".

Statefulness and local-file access are not spelled out in the ``description``
text: both are structured fields the tool descriptions render as tags, so prose
saying the same thing only costs prompt tokens and can drift out of step with the
mechanism. For an acp preset they are not spelled out because they are not
*known* here -- the handshake reports them.

#             No streaming to configure: `exec --json` emits no partial event,

#   openclaw: openclaw agent --json --session-id {agent_id} -m {prompt}
#             (create and resume are the same call; --json is required because
#             plain output interleaves ANSI plugin diagnostics on stdout.
#             NOT --local, which the shipped preset used to carry: it bypasses
#             the OpenClaw Gateway and resolves models in-process, so it needs
#             every model registered under models.providers[].models[] -- a table
#             an install that talks to its gateway never has to fill in.
#             Measured: the same prompt fails through --local with a chain of
#             `Unknown model ... no matching models.providers["openrouter"]`
#             failovers and succeeds in reaching the gateway without it. The
#             general rule this is an instance of: invoke an external agent the

later inside the adapter with the same sentence. Listed only where the shim
really does reach for a local install: ``pi-acp`` launches ``pi`` and fails
with "executable not found" without it. The other two shims bring their agent
along -- ``codex-acp`` ships it as its own binary, and ``claude-agent-acp``

what decides which Claude models the row can reach: 0.66.0 bundled CLI 2.1.220,
which refuses a model newer than it knows ("version 2.1.251 or newer is
required"), so an account whose Claude settings name a recent model could not
connect at all; 0.79.0 bundles 2.1.274.
