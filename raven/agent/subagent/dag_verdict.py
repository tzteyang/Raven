"""Did this node accomplish its task? One constrained model call, and its refusals.

A node is `completed` today the moment its backend returns without raising, so a
sub-agent that ran to the end and reported "I could not do this, the API returned
401" produces a node every dependent then builds on. This module asks the missing
question.

Two entry points, one report shape: `judge` for a node that returned, and
`describe_failure` for one that raised -- the second already knows the outcome and
uses the model only to turn a traceback into the same structured fields.

`judge` fails open. A judge call that raises, times out, or answers without calling
the tool yields `accomplished`, which is exactly today's behaviour: failing closed
would suspend every node of every graph on one provider hiccup, an outage worse than
the bug this fixes. `describe_failure` has no such fallback -- the node did fail --
so a failed call keeps the raw error text instead.
