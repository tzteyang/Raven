"""The one table of dispatchable agents, materialized once per process.

Every consumer that has to answer "which agents exist, what can each do, and how
do I run one" reads this: ``spawn``, the DAG tool, the playbook generator's
roster. Before it there were four derivations of the same config -- the spawn
manager's backend dict, the DAG tool's, a snapshot inside the playbook
executor's private tool, and a hardcoded four-name tuple in the playbook layer --
and no two of them agreed. A hot-apply refreshed the first two independently, so
"the manager has hermes, the DAG tool does not" was a reachable state.

Two facts are kept apart on purpose:

- **how an agent is reached** (``kind`` and the transport fields) is config, and
  only the backend factory reads it;
- **what an agent can do** (:class:`AgentCaps`, :class:`Injectable`) is derived
  here and is what every consumer branches on.

That split is why a consumer can hold a name and nothing else. A caller that
switched on ``kind`` would have to grow a branch for every transport ever added.
