"""Roster-dependent validation of a DAG spec: what each sub-agent can do.

Separate from :mod:`.dag_graph`, which validates the graph against itself (ids,
edges, cycles, declared refs) and needs no knowledge of the configured agents.
The checks here compare the graph against the *roster*, so they can only run
where the roster is known -- the tool -- and they run before any node is
dispatched: a rejected graph must cost zero sub-agent runs, since these two
mistakes would otherwise burn a full multi-minute fan-out to produce output the
main agent then has to discard.

Both failures are silent rather than loud without this: reusing an ``instance``
handle on a stateless agent still *runs*, it just serializes the nodes and
starts a fresh session each time, so the downstream node reads a reply written
as if the earlier turns never happened. Handing a path to an agent that cannot
see this filesystem likewise runs, and comes back with a plausible answer about
a file it never opened.

    list releases what the previous node held. So a later node's ``mcps`` does
    take effect, and refusing it would leave a stateful group unable to change or
