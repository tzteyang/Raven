"""A worker's charter: what the turn it is about to run may see and do.

The other half of ``delegate``. The host writes a charter per worker and ships
it with the dispatch; this is what the worker's own process reads it back into,
and the scope the turn then runs under.

Two things make this its own module rather than part of ``delegate``:

- **Direction.** ``delegate`` is what a dispatching turn offers; a charter is
  what a dispatched turn is held to. One is read by ``spawn``, the other by the
  assembler and the tool registry, and a module serving both would be imported
  by everything.
- **Trust.** A charter arrives from another process. It is narrowed against what
  this install already allows rather than applied as given, and the narrowing
  belongs next to the type rather than at each reader.

Narrowing, never widening. The host may say "only these tools for this job";
it may not say "and also this one you have switched off". Every field is
therefore an intersection with what this process would have done anyway, which
is the same rule ``_narrow_build`` states for a builtin row's allow-lists and
the same one the tool registry's off switch follows.
