        correlates the two; it rides ``origin`` so every ``subagent.status``
        frame can name the tool row the run belongs to.

        ``authored_task`` is the task as the dispatching model wrote it, given
        when ``task`` is a rendering of it that a caller resolved file inputs
        into. The sub-agent and the record get the rendering; the announcement
        quotes this instead, so a file handed over precisely to keep it out of
        the main agent's context is not read back into it on completion.

        ``workspace`` must be captured here, at spawn time, rather than read
        later inside the background task: the sub-agent outlives the calling
        turn, and the turn's working-directory binding is released once that
        turn returns.

        ``agent`` is required of the model (the spawn tool's schema makes it so,
        with the whole table as its enum), and a caller that omits it is
        normalized to the generic built-in row here -- the one place that
        substitution happens, instead of the eight ``agent or RAVEN_LOOP_AGENT``
        branches this used to be spread across. The name is unchanged from what
        those branches produced, so existing instance-registry rows and
        direct-chat records still resolve.

        ``authored_task`` is what the completion announcement shows on its
        ``Task:`` line in place of ``task`` itself; omitted, the announcement
        falls back to ``task``. Kept apart because a caller may render file
        references into ``task`` before dispatch (the spawn tool's
        ``{{ ref:<path> }}``), and that line is concatenated into the host's
