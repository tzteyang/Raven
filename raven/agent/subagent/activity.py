"""What a delegated run *did*, beside the answer it returned.

A backend already knows far more than the string it hands back: which tools the
sub-agent called, how many tokens it spent, how long it spent thinking. All of it
went to a tracing span and nowhere else (see
:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.backends.observability`), so the panel that shows a
run's transcript could only ever show two messages -- the prompt, and the answer
-- and anyone asking "what did it actually do" had to open a trace viewer to find
out. For an ACP agent that is doubly odd: the protocol reports every tool call as
it happens, and the answer arrived with all of that already collected and then
thrown away.

This module is the one seam that carries it to the record on disk.

A contextvar rather than a parameter on ``SubagentBackend.run``: that protocol has
four implementations here plus whatever a third party wrote, and widening it
would break every one of them for a field most cannot fill. A backend with
nothing to report simply never publishes, and its record looks exactly as it did.
The cli lane has no *structured* per-step account -- no tool calls, no usage --
but it does publish its console tail, which is everything that lane can see.

Nothing here may fail a run. An audit trail that takes down the work it is
describing is worse than no audit trail, so ``publish`` swallows a bad shape
rather than raising into a backend's happy path.
