class DagNodeSpec(BaseModel):
    """One node in a sub-agent DAG -- and the only definition of a node.

    A playbook's ``nodes[]`` is this model too (``raven.playbook.types``
    re-exports it), so the two cannot drift the way three separate definitions
    did: none of them was a superset, a playbook could declare ``skills`` the DAG
    had no field for, and the agent field was spelled differently on each side.

    Both wire spellings are accepted and neither is going away. A playbook file is
    camelCase (``promptTemplate``) because it is a file humans write and review in
    git; the JSON Schema handed to the model is snake_case (``prompt_template``)
    because that is the contract it already learned. The unification is at this
    model, via the camel alias generator, not at either wire format.

    Attributes:
        id (`str`):
            Node id, unique across the session rather than just this
            graph -- it is how a later graph names this node's output.
        subagent (`str`):
            Which agent runs this node: a name on the agent table, exactly as the
            roster advertises it. Any kind will do -- a built-in raven agent, a
            cli agent, an acp one. The field names a role rather than a
            provenance: whichever row it points at, that row runs this step as a
            child of the calling turn. The table it indexes is spelled
            ``subagents.agents[]`` -- the container lists identities, this field
            says which one performs the step.
        node_summary (`str`):
            A short title, for the user, naming what this node does -- the
            length of a chat title, under ten words, not a sentence. Blank
            survives the parse and is refused by ``validate_and_order`` for the
            same reason the two fields above are: a playbook may leave it for
            the model to fill.
        prompt_template (`str`):
            Template rendered into the node's prompt file.
        depends_on (`list[str]`):
            Ids of upstream nodes. One in this graph must complete
            first; one an earlier run of this session completed already
            has, so naming it only records the dependency.
        skills (`list[str] | None`):
            Skills for this node's session, by name on this machine's catalog.
            ``None`` means the agent's own menu, an empty list means no skills
            at all. Three-valued because "this step gets no skills" is a real
            instruction and folding it into ``None`` advertises its opposite.
            An agent whose row is ``injectable.skills`` has its menu narrowed to
            these; every other agent has them quoted into its prompt before
            dispatch (``dag_skills``), so the list reaches whichever kind runs
            the step. A name the catalog lacks is a notice, not a rejection.
        mcps (`list[str] | None`):
            MCP servers to attach to this node's session, on the same three-valued
            terms: omitted leaves the agent row's own default, a list replaces it,
            and an empty list attaches none. Resolved per dispatch, so a node
            sharing an ``instance`` with an earlier one may change or clear what
            that session holds; an agent whose row cannot take a list at all
            downgrades with a notice instead.
        inputs (`dict[str, object]`):
            Per-node inputs; each value is a literal string, a file
            reference of the form ``{"file": "<path>"}``, or another
            node's output as ``{"node": "<id>"}``.
        instance (`str | None`):
            Optional stateful sub-agent handle; a short, semantic name
            (e.g. ``researcher``) reused across nodes to continue one
            conversation.

    approver is shown is the whole graph, so agreeing to it is agreeing to every
