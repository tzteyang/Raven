"""The deterministic ready-set scheduler for a sub-agent DAG (Raven-native).

Ported from the RavenX reference ``_dag/_runner.py`` but decoupled from
AgentScope: node execution goes through a :class:`SubagentBackend`

    """Run a validated DAG, passing messages through files.

    ``resolve`` maps one node to the backend that runs it, so the narrowing a
    node asks for (its ``skills``) is applied per node rather than per agent name;
    it returns ``None`` for a name the agent table does not hold. ``backend``
    is the duck-typed file backend (read_file/write_file/join_path/abspath/
    file_exists). ``sandbox`` is an optional executor handed to each node backend
    (third-party CLI/OpenAI backends ignore it; a raven-loop node backend uses it).

    ``workdir``, ``run_root`` and ``nodes_root`` are different places and must
    not be collapsed into one. ``workdir`` is the session's working directory:
    it is each node sub-agent's cwd, and what ``{{ ref:<path> }}`` resolves
    against, so it has to be where the user's files are. ``run_root`` is this
    run's own directory, holding only ``graph.json`` and ``manifest.json`` --
    what describes the run rather than any one node. ``nodes_root`` is where
    the prompt/output records that describe each node are written instead,
    flat and keyed by node id rather than nested under a run -- an audit trail
    that outlives whatever the working directory is pointed at
    (raven/agent/subagent/history.py).

    They are not equally reachable by reference, though: ``nodes_root`` is a
    prefix-based reference root -- ``{{ ref:@nodes/<node_id>.out.md }}`` reads
    a node's file directly, the same file a bare ``{{ <node_id>.output }}``
    reads the contents of -- because ``sessions/`` is a protected subtree
    (raven/agent/workdir.py) that no working directory can be aimed at, so no
    relative path from ``workdir`` ever reaches it. ``run_root`` holds no
    prefix of its own: a node id already names one node for the whole
    conversation, so nothing needs to say which run produced it.

    ``subagents_root`` widens what a reference may resolve to by one
    directory: ``<session_dir>/subagents``, the parent of both ``run_root``
    and ``nodes_root``, reachable by absolute path rather than through a
    prefix. That is how a reference still reaches ``run_root``'s
    ``graph.json``/``manifest.json``, the ``spawn`` records beside it, and any
    node's artifacts written before this session's history was flattened.
    Left unset, references are confined to ``workdir`` plus ``@nodes/``.

    ``history_root`` is that same parent directory, ``<session_dir>/subagents``,
    taken as its own required root rather than derived from ``run_root``: it
    becomes the store's ``registry_root``, where the session's node registry
    lives.

    It is deliberately *not* agent home. Agent home also holds ``user_memory/``,
    ``skills/`` and every other conversation's transcript and sub-agent history;
    ``workdir.py`` keeps those three out of the agent's file surface as
    ``_PROTECTED_SUBTREES``, and a DAG graph is LLM-authored and auto-run, so a
    root that spanned them would render their contents into a third-party
    sub-agent's prompt. See
    :func:`raven.agent.subagent.prompt_paths.check_confined`.

    Node ids are unique across the session, not just across this graph: the
    session's node registry is read before validation, so a graph reusing an
    id an earlier run already took is refused, and one naming a node an
    earlier run *completed* resolves to that run's output, needing no
    ``depends_on`` entry for it. Such an entry is allowed and satisfied on
    sight; ``dag_graph.graph_deps`` is what keeps it out of the scheduling below,
    which only knows this run's statuses. Those two are separate questions --
    see :class:`.dag_store.SessionNodes`.

    ``semaphore`` caps how many nodes dispatch at once. Pass one in to share the
    cap with everything else that runs a sub-agent -- concurrent runs, and
    ``spawn`` -- rather than letting each run hold its own; ``max_concurrency``
    only sizes the private fallback built when none is given.

    ``session_key`` scopes each node's stateful ``instance`` handle (see
    :mod:`raven.agent.subagent.instances`) to this DAG's conversation, the same
    way ``spawn`` scopes its ``instance`` handle. It also scopes this run's node
    status rows in that same registry, so the caller must pass ``run_id`` (rather
    than let one be minted internally) if it needs to key a cancellation signal
    to the same id the registry records.

    ``cancel``, when set at any point during the run, cancels any node task
    currently in flight so its semaphore slot is released, records each such
    node as ``cancelled`` and every other not-yet-terminal node as
    ``skipped``; the run still finishes normally and returns a result
    describing what stopped, rather than raising.

    ``desk``, when given, is where a node the graph suspended (``status[nid]
    == "exception"``) waits for the main agent's decision: once the ready set
    is empty with at least one node suspended, the run blocks in
    ``_await_adjudications`` on that node's answer instead of ending there.
    Leaving ``desk`` unset keeps the old behavior exactly -- an empty ready
    set always ends the run. ``adjudication_timeout_s`` bounds that wait per
    node, so one answer that never arrives fails just that node instead of
    blocking the run forever.

    A ``replan`` answer interrupts the round in flight rather than waiting for
    it to drain: it gives every unfinished node a terminal status naming the
    successor run and finalizes this one. The successor itself is submitted
    by the caller, not here -- this run only reports its id back as
    ``DagRunResult.replanned_into``.

    ``on_node_start``, when given, is called once per attempt as the node is
    marked running and before it is rendered -- for a caller that needs to know
    where things stood before this node touched them.

    ``judge_node``, when given, is called after a node completes or fails to
    decide whether it actually accomplished its task; a bad verdict suspends it
    (the same ``exception`` status ``desk`` waits on) rather than letting it
    complete or fail outright, as long as ``desk`` and ``announce_exception``
    are both set and the node has continuations left under ``max_continuations``
    -- otherwise the verdict fails the node instead. ``announce_exception``
    delivers the report to the main agent through the same ``origin`` the host
    used to reach this run, the moment the node is suspended rather than only
    at the end of the run.

    ``released``, when given, is the event the host sets when the turn that owns
    this run has ended. Until it is set the adjudication wait has no deadline;
    ``adjudication_timeout_s`` is measured from the release. ``None`` clocks the
    wait from entry, which is what a backgrounded run wants.

    With no signal to race, this is a plain ``asyncio.gather`` (if that
    gather is itself cancelled from outside, gather cancels every task it is
    waiting on, same as before this function existed). With ``cancel``
    and/or ``interrupt`` given, races the round's group tasks against
    whichever signals are set, so an in-flight node is cancelled the instant
    either one fires, releasing its semaphore slot immediately rather than
    waiting for it to finish on its own.

    ``resume`` is the one signal that does not end the graph's work. It says a
    decision landed that gives the scheduler something new to dispatch, so this
    round ends early and every node still running is *returned* rather than
    cancelled; the caller passes them straight back as ``carried``, which awaits
    them alongside the next round's own tasks. That is what keeps a re-dispatch
    from waiting out an unrelated sibling, and it is why the two signals cannot
    share a parameter: ``interrupt`` means stop these nodes, ``resume`` means
    stop waiting for them.

    ``settled`` is the second soft signal and is handled exactly like ``resume``.
    It says a node reached its final status for this attempt, so the ready set is
    worth recomputing: its dependents may be dispatchable now. Without it they
    wait for every sibling of the round their dependency happened to share, which
    is the same unbounded wait ``resume`` exists to prevent -- reached here on the
    path a graph takes when nothing goes wrong at all, rather than through a
    suspension.

    The reap -- cancelling every not-yet-done task and awaiting all of them --
    lives in a ``finally`` so it still runs even if the race itself is
    interrupted by an *outer* cancellation (a tool-call timeout, turn abort,
    or gateway shutdown cancelling the task this coroutine is running in).
    Unlike ``asyncio.gather``, plain ``asyncio.wait`` does NOT cancel the
    futures it is waiting on, so without this ``finally`` an outer
    cancellation would leave an in-flight node's child process running,
    unsupervised, forever. ``return_exceptions=True`` on the final reap keeps
    a node's own exception (already handled inside ``_run_node``) or a stray
    one from a registry write from escaping and aborting an otherwise
    cleanly-cancelled run. Handed-on tasks are the sole exception to the reap,
    and they are only ever unreaped between two rounds: ``run_dag``'s own
    cancellation handler covers that gap.

    answer replans the graph.

    Reached only when nothing else can be dispatched: the report went to the
    main agent the moment the node was suspended, so this wait costs the graph
    nothing it could otherwise be doing. Nodes a `resume` handed on can still be
    running through it -- they are already tasks, and awaiting them is not what
    makes them progress -- and the round dispatched next takes them back.

    Every open node waits against one deadline, all at once rather than one
    after another -- N nodes awaited in series would cost N times `timeout_s`,
    contradicting the cap `adjudication_timeout_s` is configured against.

    That deadline measures silence, not the whole round: each decision that
    lands restarts it for the nodes still waiting. Reports reach the agent one
    turn at a time, because a conversation lane is serial, so a fixed deadline
    for the round charged a node for the time its report spent queued behind
    another node's -- far enough down the queue and a node timed out having
    never been asked at all. Silence is the thing worth failing on: it is what
    says nobody is coming, which one deadline for the round cannot distinguish
    from an agent steadily working through the queue.

    There is no deadline at all while ``released`` is given and unset: the run
    is bound to a turn that is still running, and that turn is the liveness
    signal -- the agent is in a tool loop that has the report in hand, and may
    be asking the user something only they know. The clock starts when the
    event fires, which is the moment the turn ended without deciding.

    A continued node goes back to `pending` with its message parked in
    ``continuations`` -- its dependencies are still `completed`, so the next pass
    of the ready set picks it up like any other node. Abandoned and timed-out
    nodes take the ordinary failure path, which cascades to their dependents.

    A replan ends the round for every node at once, answered or not, because the
    graph they belong to is being replaced. They stay `exception` and
    ``_apply_replan`` gives them their outcome on the next pass of the loop.

    `status` and the desk are two independent records of what is suspended. A
    node this call was never given a desk entry for (`exception` in `status`
    but not `desk.is_open`) can never be resolved -- nothing will ever call
    `resolve_dag_node` for it -- so it is failed outright before the wait
