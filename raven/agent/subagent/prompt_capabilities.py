    error is the caller's own parse step to raise -- on its own, in its own
    words -- and never something this gate catches and re-labels as a
    capability refusal.

    Args:
        placeholders (`Iterable[Placeholder]`):
            The template's parsed placeholders.

            The agent the template is aimed at, named in the error.
        reads_local_files (`bool`):
            Whether that agent can open a path on this filesystem.
        subject (`str`):
            How the message names the offending template, e.g. ``"node 'b'"``
            for a DAG node. Defaults to a phrasing that needs no such handle.
        escape_hatch (`str`):
            Extra text appended after the suggested content forms, for a fix
            besides switching forms -- e.g. a DAG moving the node to a
            different sub-agent. Empty by default.

        `DagValidationError`:
            When ``placeholders`` carries a ``_path`` form and
