    The cap exists to protect the caller's context window, and it stays where it
    is applied -- at the backend's return. What changes here is that dropping
    text now has three consequences it did not have: a warning in the log, a
    line in the reply itself, and structured counters plus the *whole* answer on
    the run's activity, from which the record writes ``out.md``.

    Silence was the defect. A capped reply ended mid-sentence, the run was
    recorded ``completed``, and the record advertised as the recovery artifact
    held the same truncated bytes -- so neither the host agent nor the user nor
    a later reader had any way to learn that the decisive paragraph had been at
    character 31000.

    ``reserved`` is text the caller has already decided to append (the cli
    lane's "not resumable" warning). It is budgeted first, then the notice, and
    only then the reply -- both lines are raven's own account of the run and are
    worth more per character than the reply's tail. Note that a caller passing
    ``reserved`` gets it back even when nothing was truncated, so the two are
    appended in one place rather than two.

    ``sink`` is the *unbounded* delta callback, for the same reason the acp
    lane's partial-turn notice takes one: a caller that streamed is never handed
    the return value a second time, so a notice riding only on it would reach
    the record and never the screen. The bounded wrapper would be the wrong one
