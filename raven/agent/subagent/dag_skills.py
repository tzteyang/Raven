"""Skills named on a node, delivered to an agent whose skill menu raven does not control.

A node's ``skills`` is a list of names on this machine's skill catalog. For a
built-in raven loop the list narrows the menu that loop is shown, which is the
cheapest possible delivery and needs nothing here. Every other agent -- an acp
peer, raven's own coding agent among them, a cli agent -- opens its own session
with its own catalog, and a name raven passes it resolves to nothing there. For
years the answer was a notice saying the list was ignored, which is a playbook
that declares a capability the run then quietly does not have.

The delivery that works for every agent that reads a prompt is the prompt, and
what goes into it is the same thing a built-in loop's menu holds: each skill's
name, one-line description and where its SKILL.md is, with the instruction to
read the one that applies. Not the body -- a skill is discovered progressively,
and ten named skills pasted whole would be ten documents the step has to read
before it starts. That is what the playbook specification promised ("folded
into this step's promptTemplate before dispatch").

Where the file is, is inside the step's own working directory: the skill's
directory is copied to :data:`SKILLS_DIR` there and the menu names the relative
path. An agent confined to its working directory -- a raven peer with
``restrictToWorkspace``, a cli agent's sandbox -- can open that where it could
not open the host's skills tree, and the host does not have to know which
agents are confined. The body is quoted only for an agent declared unable to
read local files at all (``reads_local_files`` false), because for it no path
is any good; then one skill is cut at :data:`SKILL_BODY_CAP` and the section at
:data:`SECTION_CAP`, and a cut says so. A name the catalog does not have is a
notice rather than a refusal, on the terms every capability gap has: a playbook
written on a better-equipped machine still runs here with the parts that work,
and the caller is told which part did not.
