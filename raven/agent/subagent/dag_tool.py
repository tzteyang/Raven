"""The ``run_subagent_dag`` tool: orchestrate a graph of sub-agent tasks.

This subsystem lives beside the single-call ``spawn`` surface and shares its
prompt-template layer (``prompt_*`` modules), but stays otherwise independent
of Raven's kernel: it carries its own graph model, ready-set scheduler, and
on-disk run store, is exposed as an ordinary optional Raven tool, and is NOT
routed through ``Origin.SUBAGENT`` or the spine scheduler. It is deliberately
absent from ``subagent/__init__.py`` -- re-exporting it there would make every
``SubagentManager`` import pull in the graph model, the store, and the runner.

Exposes the decoupled DAG subsystem to the main agent as an ordinary Raven
``Tool`` (string in / string out). It resolves each node's agent through the
shared agent table (:class:`raven.agent.subagent.registry.AgentRegistry`, normally
the sub-agent manager's), runs the DAG over a local file backend, and returns a
readable summary.

A run is backgrounded by default, like ``spawn``: the call returns as soon as
the graph is accepted and the result comes back later as an announced turn.
``background=false`` blocks instead -- until the graph finishes, or until a
node reports it could not accomplish its task, whichever comes first. That
report is the call's result; the agent answers it with ``resolve_dag_node``,
which returns the next report or the final result. The run is *bound* to the
turn that started it: no adjudication deadline runs while that turn lives, and
when it ends the run is *released* and behaves as a backgrounded one from then
on (see ``raven.agent.subagent.dag_adjudication.Outbox``).

Live progress (``dag_run_started`` / ``dag_node_updated`` / ``dag_run_completed``)
rides a late-bound sink — NOT the spine. The turn's conversation is delivered
per-turn via ``set_context`` (the loop calls it, like spawn/message); the sink
(wired by the host to the page's emitter) fans the event to that
conversation's subscribers, where the service translates it to an AgentScope
CustomEvent the web UI's DAG graph already renders.

        is no turn left to read an address off, so the stint carries the one it
        started with.

        """Ask the user to approve this graph. True when they did.

        ``question`` lets a caller that knows more about the run than its nodes
        ask a better question -- a stint's first round is a graph of three steps
        and also thirty rounds of them running shell commands, and the node list
        says none of that. Only :meth:`run_round` can fill it: it is absent from
        :meth:`execute`, so the composer of a graph never also writes the text a
        person approves it by. Deferred rather than a string so a round nobody
        is going to be asked about does not pay for building one.

        The gate is graph-level and there is exactly one of it, which puts a
        requirement on what the question shows: approving a graph means approving
        every step in it. The per-node lines are what that buys so far -- an id
        and an agent name per step, rather than a bare "run 6 nodes?".

        Not yet what the design asks for. It calls for marking the steps whose
        effects reach outside this machine, so a yes is informed; that is still
        missing, and the honest reason is that the criterion it proposes -- the
        node's agent holding a write-capable tool or mcp -- cannot discriminate
        today. Every built-in agent carries write_file / edit_file / exec, so the
        mark would land on every node of a typical graph and inform nobody. It
        needs a narrower notion of "reaches outside" (publishing, sending,
        spending) than "can write", and that notion does not exist yet.

        With no ask channel wired the graph runs. Not every surface has a way to
        put a question to a human (a cron trigger, an IM channel with no
        interactive reply), and letting the absence of one disable the feature
        outright would be a worse failure than proceeding -- the same trade-off a
        playbook's own top-level confirm already makes. It is recorded at info
        level so the decision is visible in a log rather than only in this comment.
