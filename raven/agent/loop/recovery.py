"""Empty-response recovery for the agent loop.

Pure decision logic, no I/O — the loop owns the side effects (appending
messages, incrementing counters, ``continue``). Kept separate from the loop so
the branching can be unit-tested in isolation, mirroring the repo's other small
policy units (nudge_policy, decision_router).

A turn that ends with no visible text would otherwise surface a canned
"no response to give" dud — a zero-score turn on weaker models. This recovers
the turn before giving up, in three bounded modes:

  PREFILL  thinking-only — the model emitted only reasoning (a structured field
           or an inline <think> block) and no body. Re-feed its own reasoning so
           it continues into the answer.
  NUDGE    post-tool empty — the model ran a tool then returned nothing. Inject a
           short user nudge so it processes the tool result.
  RETRY    plain empty — re-request with less reasoning asked for than the
           call that came back empty (:func:`lower_reasoning_effort`), and less
           on the wire rather than only in the label. Re-sent as-is it was the
           same bytes, so three retries were three guaranteed repeats of one
           failure.

A provider that refuses a trailing assistant message (its
``supports_assistant_prefill`` answers False: Anthropic with thinking on) never
gets PREFILL. The same thinking-only turn takes NUDGE after a tool, else RETRY,
so the request handed back never ends on an assistant message.

Spending every budget without a word coming back is FAIL, and the loop ends the
turn as an error the caller fails the turn on -- unless one of the turn's tools
has already put an answer in front of the reader. It is not a fourth mode --
there is nothing left to try -- it is the answer to the question the caller asks
next, which is whether this turn produced anything.

This is distinct from Sentinel's NudgeInjector / NudgePolicy, which inject
*proactive suggestions* onto an outbound reply; this module instead recovers an
empty turn before it is ever sent.

    The plain empty retry's way of asking a different question. An empty body
    with reasoning behind it is a call whose thinking spent the output ceiling
    before the answer began -- measured, five in a row at exactly the ceiling --
    so the request that has to change is the one deciding how much of that
    ceiling thinking may take.

    ``None`` in means the turn named no effort and the backend applied its own,
    which is the case the log showed: not a low request, an unstated one. It
    descends to the lowest rung this repo documents in config rather than to the
    floor, so the first retry is a stated request for little thinking and the
    next one can still differ from it.

    An effort this ladder does not carry returns None: a value a caller invented
    is not one we can reason about a rung below.

    ``wire_keys`` is the provider's answer to "what would a request for this
    effort carry" (``LLMProvider.reasoning_wire_keys``), and a rung whose answer
    equals ``current``'s is skipped rather than sent: a request that has not
    changed gets the answer that has not changed. It is a rung the label hides
    -- on the Anthropic Messages wire ``minimal`` and ``low`` both serialize to
    ``effort: low``, so descending by label alone bought a second retry that was
    the first failure again at full price. Skipping is not descending twice:
    when every rung below collapses onto this one there is nothing left to
    change and this returns None, which the caller reads as the same dead end as
