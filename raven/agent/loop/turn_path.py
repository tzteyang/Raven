        """Run the agent iteration loop.

        ``origin`` is the turn's: the watch-work judgement reads the owner's
        request off the messages, and a turn the runtime re-injected has none
        to read (``watch_work.asked_for``).

        ``drain``, when wired, is called at the top of each iteration to pull
        any user messages injected mid-turn (BusyPolicy.INJECT) and merge them
        as user turns before the next LLM call.

        ``session_key`` is the turn's real session key. It labels the
        checkpoint commit only; usage attribution deliberately carries an
        empty session key, since widening it would start filling per-session
        cost buckets that have always been empty.

        ``session_history`` is the filed record of the session this turn
        persists into -- still ending with the previous turn -- stamped once
        onto the iteration hook context. The caller owns which record that is.

        ``turn_started_at`` is when the caller's turn began, on the clock
        :func:`monotonic` reads. A caller that may run this loop more than once
        for one user turn passes it, so that the wall-clock budget and the
        elapsed time recorded at the end both measure the turn rather than the
        attempt; omitted, the attempt is the turn and the clock starts here.

        ``attempt`` is which run of the loop this is, counting from 1. It rides
        the turn's end record so a reader can tell the scope of the count beside
        it -- the iterations there are this attempt's, while the elapsed time is
        the turn's. Nothing in the loop branches on it.

        ``rerun_pending`` lets a caller that budgets reruns say this attempt is
        about to be run again, given ``(final_content, messages, status)``. It is
        asked only when the turn ended with nothing to show, and a yes means the
        terminal seam is skipped: the answer a gate would manufacture there is
        one the rerun discards, and the minutes spent making it come out of the
        turn's own clock. Omitted, the seam fires for every answerless turn,
        which is what every agent that budgets no rerun sees.

        ``spend`` is the turn's cost, which outlives this loop the way the
        clock above does: a rerun is a second attempt at one turn and bills
        into the same scope. A caller that opened no scope gets one for this
        loop alone, which bills its own calls and takes no delegated ones.

        onto the single ``emit``, return a TurnOutcome. Collapses the legacy
        output paths (a str return + the five callbacks) onto one boundary.

        Named ``run_turn`` rather than ``run``: ``run`` is the runtime keep-alive
        (executor / debug server / MCP up, then idle). A spine runner calls the
        public ``run_turn`` to satisfy the TurnRunner protocol.

        ``stream`` is the reply-assembly switch: a streaming outlet (TUI) wires
        it True so the reply goes out as StreamDelta and dissolves with no
        trailing Text; a non-streaming outlet (REPL) wires it False so the reply
        is one Text. It gates both LLM callbacks (the loop streams when either is
        wired) and the message-tool routing, so the whole reply travels one way.

        Exceptions propagate so the lane turns them into TurnFailed — run_turn
        does not catch sandbox-init to return an error string (the legacy direct
        path did; the spine surfaces it as a TurnFailed event instead).

        ``usage_sink`` lets a caller observe the turn's full token accounting
        (cost / context, richer than the three-field LoopOutcome.usage): pass a
        dict and it is filled. The TUI passes one to attach the rich usage to
        message.complete; the REPL omits it and uses LoopOutcome.usage.

        ``text_sink`` is its sibling for the reply text: pass a dict and the
        final reply lands in text_sink["text"] (the reply still goes out via
        emit — this is an observation copy, not a second delivery). cron passes
        one so its system event can tell the heartbeat what the run produced.
        Both sinks are transitional, to retire together when taps lands (a
        read-only observer of the turn's output).

        ``drain`` pulls user messages injected mid-turn (BusyPolicy.INJECT); it
        is threaded into the agent loop and consumed at the top of each iteration.
