        * ``auth_required`` -- the wait is on a person, and the answer names who
          can end it. Without this the model reads an unauthorized plugin as a
          capability that does not exist and says so.
        * ``connecting`` -- the handshake is still running. Reachable on any turn
          that overtakes it, which since ``prewarm_mcp`` is the ordinary shape of
          a first turn rather than a rarity: the turn no longer waits, so it can
          be assembled while servers are still coming up.
        * ``connected`` while the catalog is folded -- nothing else in the prompt
          names an installed server, so a model that does not think to search
          reports a capability it holds as missing. ``tool_search``'s own
          description says a catalog exists; only this says what is in it.

          This line states an inventory and promises no route, which is what keeps
          it true. This block is rendered once per turn, while the fold is decided
          per model call against an array a ``before_iteration`` hook may narrow
          first (``HookDecision.modified_tools``) -- so a turn-level sentence about
          what this request folded, or about reaching it through ``tool_search`` /
          ``tool_call``, can be falsified after it is written. "This server is
          connected and offers N tools" cannot.

          The count is the server's tools this turn's array carries, not the
          manager's ``tool_count``: that one counts every wrapper the server
          registered, including one the operator switched off, which no surface
          offers. The fold gate is only about noise -- below it every schema is in
          the array and the line tells the model nothing it cannot see.

        Rendered into the runtime-context block, not the system prompt -- the
        set changes turn to turn and must never be cached with the prefix.
