        after this copy was loaded -- archived, most visibly -- was gone the

        The child's title carries no ``title_auto`` marker, whatever the
        source's said. It is the fork's own name from here: a rename still
        wins, and nothing regenerates it behind the reader's back.

        The derived name goes in through ``set_title`` like every other name, so
        it obeys the one line and the one ceiling that rule states. Where a human
        title too long for the record is refused, this one is not: a parent named
        right up to the ceiling gives up its tail so the fork keeps a name
        (``_fork_title``).
