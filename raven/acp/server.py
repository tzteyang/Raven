"""The ACP agent's run loop: one connection, its engine, and its teardown.

The shape is deliberately flat. An editor spawns one process, speaks to it over
one pipe pair, and kills it when the window closes -- so there is no accept loop,
no connection registry, and no multi-tenant bookkeeping. What there is instead:

* **one engine per process.** ``build_rpc_stack`` builds the agent loop, the
  brokers, the subscription emitter and the turn spine, and the ACP layer is a
  translator sitting on its outbound face. The alternative -- mounting onto a
  resident gateway -- was the earlier preference and does not survive the process
  topology: an ACP agent *is* a stdio child of the editor, so there is nothing to
  mount onto unless a gateway happens to be running, and an agent that works only
  when another service is up is not an agent an editor can launch.
* **every inbound frame in its own task.** ``session/prompt`` is suspended for as
  long as the turn takes, and ``session/cancel`` has to be read *during* it.
  Handling frames inline would make cancellation unreachable, which is the one
  thing the protocol requires to always work.
* **a shutdown that answers instead of cancelling.** On EOF the pending prompts
  are settled as ``cancelled`` -- which is what the spec says a torn-down turn
  resolves as -- and only then are the handler tasks awaited. They therefore
  return through their own code, releasing their turn slots and writing their
  answers, rather than being cancelled mid-flight. It also means a finite input
  (``echo '...' | raven acp``, a scripted client, a smoke test) gets its replies:
  cancelling on EOF would answer a batch of three requests with nothing at all.
  Cancellation stays as the backstop for a handler that is stuck somewhere else.

    Per process rather than per tool, and that is the fix for what used to be a

    agent. The process IS the surface in this deployment -- one editor, one stdio
    child -- so the declaration belongs at that scope and every tool built here,
    delegated or not, inherits it.

    The families do not decide: every mutation answers to the permission
    tiers and the mode, and a declared family only supplies the line the human
    reads when a call lands on a prompt. A delegated command asks through the
    responder the parent turn bound -- the permission turn is a ContextVar the
    sub-agent's task inherits -- so ``git push`` from a sub-agent reaches the
