"""Requests this agent makes of its client, and the answers coming back.

Nothing in raven had this. ``Dispatcher`` is inbound-only and ``send_frame`` is
fire-and-forget, so a method that needs the client to *decide* something -- which
is what a permission prompt is -- had no mechanism at all. The only working
example in the repo is on the other side of the wire, in
``raven/acp_client/client.py``, and this is its mirror.

Three things make it more than a dict:

* **The id space is this agent's.** A client's request ids and an agent's are
  independent, so ``"id": 1`` inbound and ``"id": 1`` outbound are unrelated
  frames. Mixing them into one map would let a client's own request id resolve a
  promise the agent is holding.
* **Every wait ends.** A client is free to never answer -- and one of the four
  measured failure modes is exactly that. A pending future with no deadline is a
  turn that never finishes, so every call carries a timeout and the timeout is a
  normal outcome rather than an error.
* **Shutdown is an answer.** When the connection closes, everything still
  waiting is failed rather than left for the garbage collector, because the code
  awaiting it has cleanup to run.
