"""Turn a stored transcript back into the stream that produced it.

``session/load`` is not a getter. The client sends it and the agent answers by
*replaying* the conversation as ``session/update`` notifications -- the same
notifications a live turn produces -- and only then returns. So a resumed session
draws itself through the code path a fresh one draws itself through, and a client
needs no second renderer.

What makes this worth its own module is that the stored shape and the live shape
are different vocabularies. A transcript is a list of provider messages with
extras hung off them (``reasoning_content``, ``tool_calls``, ``diff``,
``notice``, ``turn_ended``); the wire is a sequence of typed chunks. The mapping
is order-sensitive in one place that matters: a tool call is announced on the
assistant entry that made it and answered by a later ``role="tool"`` entry, so
the ``tool_call`` and its ``tool_call_update`` come from two different messages
and must stay in that order.

The other rule the marks carry is whose voice an entry is in. ``notice`` and
``turn_ended`` mark assistant entries the runtime wrote for the model to read,
so their stored text is never replayed as the assistant speaking -- the live
wording for the same event is sent in its place, from :mod:`raven.acp.updates`.

Pure and synchronous on purpose. Everything here is list-in, list-out, so each
case is one unit test whose frames are checked against the official schema --
which is also what makes a replay bug cheap to find, since the alternative is
reading it off a client's screen.

**What is lost, stated rather than papered over.** ``_map_to_wire`` flattens a
multimodal user message to the text of its text blocks, so an image a person
attached three turns ago replays as the words around it. Recovering it means
reading ``raw.messages`` instead, where the blocks are still intact -- and then
re-reading files that may no longer exist. Not attempted here.
