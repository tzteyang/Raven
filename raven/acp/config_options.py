"""The model selector, as the protocol's stable configuration surface.

``session/set_config_option`` is the channel, and the important thing about that
sentence is what it replaces: ``session/set_model`` does not exist in the stable
schema, and neither does ``models.availableModels``. Both appear in older
material and in some clients' expectations; an agent that waited for either would
never be asked to switch a model. The stable form is a generic option list where
one entry carries ``category: "model"``.

Two facts about raven shape what is offered here, and both are stated in the
option's own ``description`` rather than only in a document, because the schema
declares that field as text for the client to display:

* **The switch is scoped to the calling session.** ``set_model`` sends the
  session id and no ``scope``, so ``config.set`` binds that session and leaves
  ``agents.defaults`` alone; a connection with two sessions open no longer
  changes both. The protocol's shape says otherwise, which is why it is said
  where a person will read it.
* **A running turn is not interrupted.** It keeps the binding it entered with,
  so the change takes effect on that session's next turn. Nothing refuses the
  call. A refusal the runtime does still make -- a value it will not write --
  travels out with its own code instead of being flattened.

Both read the other way round before v0.1.13 moved the model onto a per-session
binding, and the description outlived the behaviour it described for a while
afterwards. Whatever this file says here has to match ``MODEL_DESCRIPTION``,
because that string is the copy a person actually sees.

Only ``category: "model"`` is exposed. Raven has other hot-changeable config, but
a selector for each would put a settings panel in an editor's session menu, and
the ones worth exposing there are the ones a person changes mid-conversation.
