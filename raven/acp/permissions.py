"""Ask the client's user before running a protected command.

Raven already has an approval round trip, and this is not a second one: it is a
second *transport* for the same one. The permission gate
(``raven.permissions``) calls ``ApprovalResponder.await_approval`` when a call
needs a human; the TUI's implementation emits ``approval.request``
on its own wire, and this one sends ``session/request_permission`` on the ACP
wire. Everything about authority stays where it was -- the model never decides,
and the gate is what remembers a grant.

Two shapes of the protocol constrain what can be offered:

* **"Always" here means this session.** The gate keeps a session grant on the
  conversation (``raven.permissions.session``), so ``allow_always`` is offered
  and answers as ``ALLOW_SESSION``: the editor's user sees the command stop
  asking for the rest of the session, which is what the kind promises a
  client to render. The persisted rule the TUI and the web can write needs a
  text the human confirms, and this wire has no editor for one, so that grant
  is not offered here.
* **A refusal is a selection.** ``RequestPermissionOutcome`` has exactly two
  variants, ``cancelled`` and ``selected``; there is no ``denied``. Rejecting is
  ``selected`` carrying a reject option's id.

**Every client failure is handled here, and every one of them denies.** Measured
from the client direction on codex-acp: any error in reply to this request
cancels the whole turn -- so the mirror rule is that nothing from the client may
escape this function. Four ways it can go wrong, all of them seen in the wild:
no answer at all, a JSON-RPC error, an option id nobody minted, and an explicit
``cancelled``. Options are minted per request and the answer is checked against
that set, so a client replying with a stale or invented id is refused rather than
believed -- and so is a client that answers "the first option" without reading
the kinds.
