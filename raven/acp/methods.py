"""The ACP methods raven answers, and how each maps onto an existing RPC call.

Every handler here goes through ``Dispatcher.dispatch`` rather than importing the
handler it wants. That is deliberate: ``turn.send`` / ``turn.cancel`` /
``turn.subscribe`` / ``fs.upload`` are already assembled, already validated
against their pydantic models, and already carry the guards (model availability,
one turn per lane, the upload size limit) that a second call path would have to
grow its own copy of. The cost is one dict round trip per call, against a turn
that takes seconds.

Two rules run through the whole file:

* **Tolerant inbound.** Unknown params are ignored, a wrongly-typed
  ``protocolVersion`` is read for intent, and an unknown method is *answered*
  rather than dropped. The spec asks for this, and the failure it prevents is the
  worst one available: a client left waiting on a promise nothing will resolve.
* **A prompt is never answered with a JSON-RPC error.** Whatever happens to the
  turn -- refused before it started, failed halfway, cancelled -- the client gets
  a ``stopReason``, with the explanation as message content. Measured on
  codex-acp from the other direction: an error in reply to a turn-shaped request
  makes clients tear down the whole turn.
