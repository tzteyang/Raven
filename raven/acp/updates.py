"""Translate raven's outbound wire events into ACP ``session/update`` frames.

This is the sink handed to ``build_rpc_stack``, which threads the *same*
``send_frame`` through the subscription emitter, all three brokers, the MCP
event bridge and the system methods. One sink therefore intercepts the entire
outbound surface -- which is the reason to sit here rather than to register an
outlet: ``spine/delivery.py``'s hub sink returns early on ``TurnStarted`` /
``TurnFailed`` / ``TurnEnded``, so an object registered only as an outlet never
sees a turn end, and a suspended ``session/prompt`` would never be answered.

The cost, stated rather than hidden: this parses a dict that was serialised one
layer up, and whatever ``RpcOutlet`` dropped is dropped for good (a progress
notice has no wire event at all, so no branch here can recover it).

Two invariants hold the turn together:

* **Exactly one terminating event resolves a prompt.** The gate on
  :class:`_Turn` makes a second one a no-op rather than an error, because a
  cancel followed by the sink's own failure event is the normal shape, not a bug.
* **A prompt is never answered with a JSON-RPC error.** A turn that failed still
  ends with a ``stopReason``; the failure is surfaced as message content. The
  narrower rule this replaces -- "suppress the -32099 cancel event" -- would
  have been wrong: that event is the *only* signal a cancelled turn produces.
