"""Which role may write which path, and what to do when one writes elsewhere.

Three grades per path glob. ``owns`` is free, ``appends`` may only add -- a diff
with deletions is a violation -- and anything unlisted may not be written at
all. A fourth answer, ``artifacts``, is for paths with no author: a build writes
them, so grading them by ownership would revert a measurement for having been
made.

Globs overlap by design, in two different ways. One role owns ``tools/**``
while another owns ``tools/gate_checks/check_verify_*.py``: there **the more
specific pattern wins**, the way ``.gitignore`` resolves the same question. But
one role owning ``FIXLOG.md`` while another appends to it is not a contest at
all -- it is the shape the ownership table is built on, so both keep their
grade, however exactly either one spells the path. What is refused is two roles
claiming one pattern at the *same* grade: two owners is a declaration nobody
should guess the meaning of.

Where the declaration comes from is the caller's business. H* reads it out of
the frontmatter of a guard file a person edits by hand; a playbook running
``mode: stint`` reads it off the role's own row. Both build the same
:class:`Roster` and ask it the same question.
