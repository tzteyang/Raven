"""What is waiting on a person, and how their answer gets back into the project.

``.stint/HUMAN_DECISIONS.md`` is the one file no agent writes. A role that hits
something only a person can settle asks for it, the Planner carries the question
here, and the run goes on around it -- which is what keeps one open question from
stalling a round.

Two things this module adds to that arrangement:

* **an id and a state per question**, so an answer can be recorded rather than
  guessed at from a file's prose, and so a question can name the tasks it holds
  up. That link is worth its weight three times: a page can say "this is holding
  up three tasks", answering unblocks them without the Planner having to
  remember, and the share of work blocked on a person is the honest measure of
  whether the project can run unattended at all.
* **a queue.** An answer submitted from a page arrives while a role may be
  mid-turn in the same checkout, so it is parked in the run's state directory and
  merged at the start of the next round, before the Planner reads. Writing
  straight into the project would race the role's own writes and could be undone
  by the enforcement pass; and changing a settled matter halfway through a round
  should wait for the boundary anyway.
