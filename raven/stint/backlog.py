"""The backlog: the one structured thing three roles share.

Everything else a stint writes is prose, because prose is what a role writes
well. This file is structured because three roles have to change different parts
of one row -- the Planner schedules, the Builder submits, and only Verifier may say
a thing is done -- and "one file, one owner" cannot hold for a prose file three
roles must edit. Per-field ownership can, and only structure makes it checkable.

Two levels. A **task** is a unit of work; an **implement** is one Builder
attempt at it. One task has many implements, which is what makes "this was
attempted three times" readable -- repeated failure is the signal most worth
surfacing, and a round report cannot show it.

Nothing here is edited by hand. Every change goes through :func:`apply`, which
refuses a transition the calling role does not own, so an illegal move is a
refusal at the command rather than a violation found afterwards by diffing a
file. See ``docs/specs/2026-09-17-playbook-rounds-design.md``.
