"""The roles a project declares, read out of the guard files a person edits.

A role is a file in the project -- ``.stint/planner.md`` and its siblings --
carrying frontmatter for the runtime and prose for the model. One file, both
halves editable by hand, which is the whole point: the boundary a person wants
to move is moved by editing the boundary, not by editing raven.

The frontmatter answers four questions the loop has to ask:

* **order** -- where in the round this role runs. Absent means it is not in the
  round at all, which is how a one-shot bootstrap phase or a parallel role is
  declared without the loop having to know about it.
* **session** -- ``fresh`` opens a new conversation each round, ``continue``
  keeps one across the whole run. The roles genuinely differ: a Planner picking
  from a backlog needs last round's reports and nothing else, while a Builder
  carrying an implementation in its head is worse off starting over.
* **owns / appends / reads** -- three grades of access, per path glob.
* **enforce** -- whether those are checked by the program or only stated in the
  prompt. Stated-only is honest; a boundary announced as enforced and quietly
  unenforceable is not.

What a grade *means*, and how overlapping globs resolve, is not H*'s own and
lives in :mod:`raven.stint.ownership`. What stays here is where the
declaration comes from -- a guard file on disk -- and what a run must be able
to assume before it starts. The generic names are re-exported so callers that
have always read them from here keep working.
