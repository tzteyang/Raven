"""Turning a project into one a stint can work in.

Two phases, deliberately not one. ``init`` reads the **file tree** and lays out
the scaffolding: the ``.stint/`` directory, a link to whatever the project already
calls its specification, the facts this machine can be asked for, and a guard
file per role. ``plan`` reads the **prose** and produces the backlog.

They are separated for three reasons. Their inputs differ, as above. The place a
person has to stand differs: a wrong directory shows up next round, a wrong plan
takes ten rounds to surface, so the confirmation gate belongs on the plan. And
they re-run at different times -- a revised specification needs a re-plan, not a
re-scaffold.

This module is ``init``. It calls no model: everything here is either a fact
about the machine, a template with its slots filled, or a link. What it cannot
know -- what the work actually is -- is exactly what ``plan`` is for.

PLAN_SENTINEL = "ROUNDS_PLAN_DONE"

PLAN_PROMPT = """You are setting up a stint on this project, and your one job is the plan.

Read the specification and what a person has already settled:

- `{spec}`
- `{decisions}`

## First, carry over what the project already knows

A project may arrive half-built, with its rules, lessons and open questions
spread over the documents it grew up with. From the first round on, the roles
read `.stint/` first and open those documents only where `.stint/` points them --
so before you plan, every decision, lesson and defect they hold has to be in
`.stint/`, and everything else has to be findable from it. The documents are:

{documents}

Read every one of them, and move what they hold by kind:

- a rule or decision that is settled -> `{decisions}`, under `## Settled`, one
  line each, ending in `(source: <the document>)`;
- a question nobody has answered -> `raven playbook stint ask "<the question>" --project
  {project}`, one call each; carry the leaning the document records as `--decide "..."`
  when it has one;
- a lesson, a pitfall, a convention, how the thing is run and proved -> the body
  of `{playbook}`;
- a defect that was found and fixed -> a row of `{fixlog}`;
- a choice an agent made where the specification was silent -> `{agent_decisions}`;
- reference material -- an asset plan, a scene brief, an event contract, a
  tuning table, anything a role consults rather than obeys -> is **not**
  copied. It gets a row in the reading map below, and the role opens the
  document itself when the map says to. Copying it made `.stint/` a second copy
  of the same pages, which is not what a reference is for;
- a reference image -- a scene reference, a concept sheet, anything under
  `refs/` -- is a document too, and the one a brief about it can never stand
  in for. It gets its own row, naming the tasks whose Builder and Verifier must
  open the image itself before building or judging, and what to look for in
  it. Put the same instruction in those tasks' notes.

Do not copy documents whole, and do not edit or delete them: they stay as they
were, read-only. When you are done, write `{sources}`: **the reading map**, a
table with one row per document above -- what the document is, in a line; what
was carried out of it and where; and when a role should still open it, naming
the sections that matter (or `nothing to carry` with the reason: a template, a
report superseded by a later one, a duplicate of the specification). A document
missing from that map is a document the roles will never see again.

A project that has been thought about already says somewhere what has to happen
before what, and that ordering is the most valuable thing in this whole exercise:
it was paid for in someone's experience, and re-deriving it from the acceptance
table alone gets it wrong. Carry it into the backlog below as `depends_on`.

## Then, look at the tree

The documents say what was meant; the tree says what is. Before you write a
task, find out which of the work already exists. This repository is laid out to
its own convention, not to anyone's template, so look rather than assume:

- list the top level and find where the code lives -- `src/`, `project/`,
  `app/`, `lib/` are common names, but the answer is whatever holds the thing
  being built;
- find how it is built and proved -- a `Makefile`, `package.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `project.godot`, a CI file, a `tools/` or `scripts/`
  directory of checks -- and run what runs, keeping the output;
- find any record of earlier work -- a changelog, notes, evidence folders, and
  the briefs and Verifier reports of earlier rounds if this project ran under H*
  before (by default under `reports/`) -- and read it: it says what was tried,
  what was verified, and what came back.

A quick scan of this tree, as a starting point and not the map:

{tree}

A task for a capability that is already in the tree is not `open`: see `state`
below.

## Then, the backlog

Write `{backlog}`: every piece of work this project needs, in the order the
dependencies allow. This is the pool the Planner picks each round from, so it is
the only thing standing between the loop and thirty rounds of drift.

## The shape

```json
{{
  "meta": {{"planned_at": "", "confirmed_by_human": false}},
  "tasks": [
    {{"id": 1, "source": "spec:7.1", "name": "two to five words",
      "title": "one sentence: what done looks like", "gates": ["7.1"],
      "depends_on": [], "state": "open",
      "note": "only when the plan would not obviously have it"}}
  ]
}}
```

- **`id`** counts from 1 and is never reused.
- **`name`** is what a board card and a log line call the task, two to five
  words; **`title`** is the sentence that says what done looks like.
- **`source`** is where the task came from: `spec:<section or gate>` for
  everything you derive here.
- **`gates`** are the specification's own acceptance ids, when it declares any.
  A task can carry none -- the tooling that measures the others is itself work,
  and it has no gate of its own.
- **`depends_on`** is the plan's skeleton: what must settle before this can
  start. Write the real dependency, never a round number. A schedule goes stale
  the first time something takes two rounds; a dependency does not.
- **`state`** is `open` for work that is not in the tree. Work that already is
  goes in as `in_review`, with `"implements": [{{"round": 0, "commit": "<the sha
  it lives at>", "verdict": null, "evidence": "<the evidence path, if any>"}}]`,
  so the first round's Verifier verifies what the project inherited instead of the
  loop trusting it. Nothing is `done`: only Verifier, holding evidence, says that --
  the person confirming this plan may overrule by hand.

## What makes this plan good rather than a list

1. **Order by dependency, and say why.** If the specification states an order
   outright -- "no tuning before the measuring tool exists" -- that is a
   `depends_on`, not a sentence you drop.
2. **Cover every gate.** A gate no task moves is a requirement nobody planned
   for. Check at the end.
3. **Infrastructure first, and it is real work.** Whatever measures the build --
   the harness, the log, the determinism check -- is a task like any other, and
   almost everything depends on it.
4. **One task is one round's worth of work at most.** A task nobody can finish
   in a round will be attempted three times and reopened twice.
5. **Do not invent requirements.** Where the specification is silent on
   something that matters, do not decide it: say so in your reply, and a person
   settles it before the first round.

Write the file, then end your reply with `{sentinel}` on a line of its own,
and above it list: how many tasks, which gates each covers, and anything the
specification left open that a person has to settle first.
