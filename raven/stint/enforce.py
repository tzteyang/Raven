"""Undoing what a role wrote outside the paths it may write.

The pass that makes a boundary a boundary. The last of its three layers: the
prompt says what a role owns, the role's checks measure what it built, and this
runs after the role has stopped, puts back what it wrote elsewhere, and puts
that on the record. Without it the prompt is advice. Nothing refuses a write
before it lands -- a charter narrows a role's tools only where a playbook
declares one, and ``owns`` is not derived into one -- so this pass is the
boundary, not its backstop.

**Two sources, and they are not interchangeable.** Given ``stage_base`` the
pass reads the stage's own commits as well as the worktree. Without it, a role
that committed its stray write has already vanished from ``git status`` and the
pass finds nothing to undo -- which quietly makes the boundary advisory for
exactly the roles that know how to use git, the ones most able to cross it.

What a grade *means* is not decided here: the caller passes a ``grade``
callable, so a project reading guard files and a playbook reading its own role
rows both get this pass without one of them having to pretend to be the other.
