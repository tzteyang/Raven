"""Laying out a project a stint is written against, before it runs.

A playbook names a layout (``setup: stint``) and this writes the missing half
of it. It exists because the alternative was seven commands: a person who said
"run rounds" in a repository that had never been set up got a stint whose
every round failed on a file reference, thirty times, because ``{{ref:}}``
resolves at node render and nothing checked earlier.

Deterministic on purpose, and free. Nothing here calls a model, nothing here
commits, and nothing here is irreversible: it writes files that are not there,
and a file that is there is left alone. What it cannot supply itself -- a
specification, which is the one thing only the person has -- it reports as
missing rather than inventing.

Kept out of the driver because the driver's job is rounds and this is a
project's shape, and out of the playbook because a playbook is a file that
travels: a setup section that could name *what* to write would be a way to make
the host write anything, so a playbook names a recipe and the recipe ships here.
