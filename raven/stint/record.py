"""A multi-round run's own record, and the file it survives a restart in.

One stint is one run of a `mode: stint` playbook: an id, a tree of its own, and a
round counter. Everything about it that matters is in one JSON file, which is
what makes "any process can pick this up again" true rather than aspirational.
The alternative -- keeping it in the memory of whichever gateway started it --
is the arrangement H* has, and a gateway restart ends those runs.

The file carries a *snapshot of the filled spec*, not the playbook's name. A
stint resumed a day later must not depend on the playbook still being installed,
on its parameters still being in somebody's conversation, or on the library not
having been edited in between. What the stint runs is what it was started with.

Written whole and moved into place, because the reader is often another process
and a half-written stint reads as a corrupt one.
