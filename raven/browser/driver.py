"""A single Chromium page, driven over CDP by both the agent and the reader.

Design notes worth keeping:

* **The page is shared, not per-caller.** The agent's tools and the GUI panel
  address one page. That is what lets a reader log in by hand and the agent
  continue on the other side of the login.
* **Several agents, one browser, one tab each.** A caller that names an
  ``owner`` (a conversation, a sub-agent run) is bound to a tab: the active one
  if nobody else holds it, otherwise a fresh one. Its later calls land on that
  tab whatever the panel is showing, and each of its actions brings the tab to
  the front so the panel shows what the model is doing. Callers with no owner
  are the reader's own hands.
* **Reading is structural, not visual.** ``snapshot`` walks the DOM for the
  handful of things a caller acts on and hands back stable ``ref`` ids. Asking
  the model to find a button in a JPEG costs far more and works less often, so
  screenshots are for showing the reader and for final visual checks.
* **Nothing starts until something asks.** Chromium is launched on the first
  navigation, so a Raven that never opens a page never pays for one.
* **Playwright is an extra.** Every entry point raises ``BrowserUnavailableError``
  with an install hint the reader can actually run rather than an ImportError
  traceback.
