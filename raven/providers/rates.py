"""What a model costs per token and how much context it takes.

Both are facts about a provider's catalogue, so they are decided here and not by
whoever is about to report a number: a provider decision made outside
``raven.providers`` grows a second copy, and the copies answer differently.

Two questions, deliberately answered from different places:

* **rates** price a call after it happened. A wrong figure costs an inaccurate
  total, so the ladder can reach for a community-maintained catalogue.
* **the context window** sizes trimming, so it shapes the next request. Only the
  tables that also route may answer it, and an unknown window is answered with
  ``None`` -- the caller keeps its configured default, which is honest, where a
  window borrowed from another vendor is silently wrong.

#: 200000 was 65536, inherited from the legacy per-agent setting the config
#: migration retired (``config/loader.py``). The two ways a guess is wrong are
#: not symmetric -- too small over-trims, which degrades silently, and too large
#: lets a request exceed the real window, which the vendor refuses outright --
#: and 65536 was chosen against the second. Which models actually reach here
#: made the first the one that kept happening: only a model NO catalogue knows
#: is sized by this number, and that is in practice a model newer than the
#: pinned LiteLLM table rather than a small one. A genuinely smaller deployment
#: is sized wrong by any guess and has the knob that outranks every catalogue,
#: ``agents.defaults.contextWindowTokens``; a million-token model cut to a
#: sixteenth had nothing but this line.
DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS = 200_000

# How much room one call is given to answer when *nothing* can answer for the
# model. A declaration is honoured as declared (see
# ``resolve_max_output_tokens``), so this is no longer a bound on every call --
# it is the answer for a self-hosted deployment, a gateway, or a model newer
# than every catalogue.
#
# 64000 was 16384 until a measured deck run spent 18m33s and 81920 output
# tokens on five calls that returned an empty body: the model reasoned to a
# 16384-token wall every time and the answer never started. That wall was not
# this constant -- captured request bodies show no ``max_tokens`` reaching the
# wire on either path -- it was applied downstream, and the only established
# way to move it is to ask: the same endpoint served 40000 in full when a
# request named it, and accepts 64000 without refusing.
#
# Deliberately not raised past 64000, which was measured rather than assumed.
# This number answers exactly the rows ``_trustworthy_ceiling`` rejects, and
# ``openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`` is one of them: it files 1000000
# for both its window and its ceiling where Anthropic's real ceiling is 64000,
# and a request carrying more classifies as ``invalid_request`` -- not
# retryable, so the turn dies rather than degrades. 64000 is the smallest
# ceiling among the current claude models, so no vendor refuses it, and it is
# room for a whole file.
DEFAULT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 64_000

# How much of the window a ceiling must leave for the prompt beside it. Both
# walls a request can hit are stated as the *sum*: OpenRouter refuses with
# "maximum context length is 1048576 tokens, however you requested about
# 10000008 (8 of text input, 10000000 in the output)", and a vLLM endpoint
# publishes only ``max_model_len``, with no separate output cap at all. So a
# ceiling is not bounded by a fraction of the window, it is bounded by what the
# prompt cannot do without.
#
# 16384 is the measured floor with room to work in: this repo's default agent
# spends 8606 tokens before any conversation at all (7279 on 20 tool
# definitions, 1327 on the system prompt), and what is left over is the turn's
# own text and a tool result. It replaces a blanket half-the-window rule, which
# was measured to clamp 30.5% of the OpenRouter rows and 33.1% of the LiteLLM
# rows whose declarations we honour -- ``x-ai/grok-4.3`` declares 900000 of a
# 1000000 window and was being cut to 500000, and vendors declare up to 0.9 of
# their window routinely.
MIN_PROMPT_TOKENS = 16_384

# How much of the window a single reply may reserve. A third question, distinct
# from the two constants above: they say what a model is able to emit, this says
# what one reply plausibly is. The unit is the Iteration, not the Turn -- a turn
# runs one LLM call per round of tools, and every one of them reserves this
# number again. Asking for the whole declared ceiling trades window for headroom
# no reply reaches: a model declaring 131000 inside a 204800 window leaves the
# prompt 73800, and a 73878-token prompt is a 400 no retry can fix.
#
# Asking short is the cheaper way to be wrong, not a free one. The loop
# continues a reply that came back *empty* at the ceiling -- prefill, a
# reasoning-effort descent, ``OUTPUT_LIMIT_NUDGE`` -- and it refuses a tool call
# whose arguments were cut so ``Tool.truncation_hint`` reaches the model. A
# non-empty reply that stopped at the ceiling gets none of that:
# ``classify_empty_response`` answers COMPLETE on any visible text, so the loop
# persists it, ends the turn, and the caller reads a truncated answer as a whole
# one. Set this too low and that is what it buys.
#
# Measured over 4437 recorded calls: p95 is 7389, p99 is 16084, and the single
# call past this number spent 45132 of its 45330 tokens reasoning to emit 198.
# The largest output that was not reasoning is 25273, so the margin here is
# about 30 percent rather than the comfortable multiple the percentiles alone

    the sending -- it is answering about a request it would make, not reading a
    stranger's catalogue. The direct row is asked first for the same reason:
    asked alias-first, one model reported half its window at half its price.

    A bare id -- no prefix -- reaches tier 1 and tier 4 only. Tiers 2 and 3 are
    both keyed by vendor, and matching a bare name across either is what priced a
    self-hosted deployment at a hosted model's rate. A bare id left by an older
    version is priced as unknown until its model is picked again, which stores it
    qualified.

    Three questions, asked in a documented order and answered from whatever can

    and each is a bound on the one before rather than a replacement for it.

    **What does it declare?** ``declared_max_output_tokens`` walks the tables
    that also route the request -- LiteLLM's own metadata, then OpenRouter's
    catalogue for an id naming OpenRouter -- and whatever they say is the
    ceiling the two bounds below apply to. A declaration is the serving side's
    own answer, so it is never *substituted* for: standing our fallback in its
    place had a 131072-token endpoint answered with a guess on every call, and
    lost the declarations below the fallback along with it. Honouring one is
    safe because the declaration is filtered first: ``_trustworthy_ceiling``
    drops the rows that file a window as a ceiling, which is where every absurd
    figure came from. ``DEFAULT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`` answers only where nothing
    declares -- a self-hosted deployment, a gateway, a model newer than every
    catalogue.

    **How much of the window may it take?** A ceiling is room asked for
    *inside* the window: both walls a request can hit are stated as the sum of
    prompt and reply, and the loop reserves exactly this number and hands the
    prompt whatever is left. So it is bounded to leave ``MIN_PROMPT_TOKENS``
    behind -- or half the window where the window is too small to spare that
    much, which is the same number at 32768 and below it the only split that
    leaves both sides something.

    **How much will one iteration use?** ``MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_ITERATION``.
    The bound above keeps the prompt from being squeezed to nothing, but it only
    bites where the window is tight; a declaration well inside a large window
    passes it untouched and still reserves far more than one reply emits. That
    is the same trade seen from the other side -- window spent on headroom --
    and it is what left a 1048576-token model running on 104858 tokens of
    prompt. The unit is the Iteration: a turn pays this once per LLM call, not
    once in total.

    ``window`` is that window, and it is why this generalizes past the models a
    catalogue knows: the caller passes the one the turn is actually running on
    (``ModelBinding.context_window``, which honours an explicit
    ``contextWindowTokens`` first), so a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint --
    a volc vLLM deployment publishing only ``max_model_len``, a self-hosted
    server -- is sized by its operator's own number rather than by a catalogue
    that has never heard of it. Absent that, the catalogue answers, and absent
