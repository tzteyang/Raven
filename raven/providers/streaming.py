"""Driving one ``provider.chat_stream`` call to a finished ``LLMResponse``.

Shared by the agent loop and by the sub-agent backend that streams a direct
chat reply: both run the same shape of call -- tools, reasoning, reconnects --
and a copy would drift on the first provider quirk fixed in one and not the
other.

Nothing here knows about a turn, a session, or an outlet. The caller supplies
the provider and the two delta callbacks; what it does with them is its own.

    When a turn caller wires ``on_token_delta``, its loop diverts here instead
    of to ``chat_with_retry``. Each non-empty content chunk fires the callback;
    tool_call fragments are merged positionally; the final response object is
    shape-compatible with what ``chat()`` would have returned.

    The tool-call merge is by ``index``: ``id`` and ``function.name`` are taken
    from the first fragment carrying them, and ``function.arguments`` is the
    concatenation of the per-fragment argument strings.

    A failure that already streamed deltas is not retried -- the caller has
    rendered them, so a second attempt would duplicate its output. The rule holds
    however the failure arrives: a provider that hands one back as its terminal
    error delta instead of raising has that delta's verdict spent of its
    retryability, so the caller's own ladder does not ask again either. Before the
    first delta there is nothing to duplicate, so a retryable error reconnects up
    to ``max_reconnects`` times at once, then waits out ``retry_delays`` -- the
    loop's own ladder, seconds to minutes, for a gateway that serves error pages
    for a while -- asking again after each wait. Once both are spent the exception
    propagates: a mid-turn provider error is the turn's failure (the lane emits
    TurnFailed), not a text reply about one. Two outcomes come back as an error
    response (``finish_reason="error"`` with its classification) instead of
    raising, because their recovery belongs to the caller: a stream the upstream
    closed before its terminal chunk with nothing deliverable in it, classified
    as a network failure for the loop to wait out its own ladder on -- retryable
    unless a thought had already reached the watcher -- and ``strip_images``,
    whose recovery is a change to the messages that only the loop can make.

    ``stream_kwargs`` reaches ``chat_stream`` unchanged. It exists because that
    signature carries *literal* generation defaults rather than the provider's
    own ``generation`` settings, so a caller whose non-streaming path went
    through ``chat_with_retry`` has to pass them explicitly to keep the two
