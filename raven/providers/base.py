    One function for both the request body and the agent loop's ceiling check.
    Computed separately the two would drift the moment either side grew a
    bound, and the check would stop firing without ever failing.

    A pin is a call site asking for a deliberately short answer, so it wins --
    but never above what the model accepts. Every pin in the tree today is far
    below any real ceiling, which is exactly why the bound has to be written
    down: the first pin that is not would be a rejected request, and nothing
    about the call site would say why.

    ``pinned`` is the per-call argument (``judge`` asks for 64, the curator for
    2048); the settings object carries the per-provider one. The argument has
    to arrive here rather than bypass the function, or the two ways of asking
    for a short answer are bounded by different rules and only one of them is
    the number truncation is judged against.

    ``allow_fetch=False`` is for callers that only need a reservation and must
    not stall on the catalogue's importing tier (~2-7s in a fresh process);
    they get whatever is already loaded, then the fixed fallback. A caller
    about to build a request wants the default.

    Absent a pin the answer is ``resolve_max_output_tokens`` -- what the model
    itself declares, bounded to leave room for the prompt beside it. How much
    of the window a turn holds back for its reply is the budget's business, and
    it reserves exactly this number, so the prompt has to fit beside the
    ceiling the request carries.

    The window handed to the resolver is the running turn's own, not a
    catalogue lookup, so the bound works for a provider no catalogue lists: an
    operator who pinned ``contextWindowTokens`` for a custom OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint sized this ceiling too, rather than having it fall to the
    unknown-model default. Outside a turn there is no binding and the resolver
    falls back to the catalogue on its own.

    ``model`` must be the id the request will go out under, not the spelling it
    is configured with. The two differ (``z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`` against
    ``openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3-flash``) and only the second reaches the
    OpenRouter tier, so passing the configured name is what had the loop
    reserve 32768 against a request carrying 64000. Callers holding a provider
    should pass ``provider.wire_model_id(model)``.
