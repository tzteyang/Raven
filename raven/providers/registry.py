"""
Provider Registry — what Raven knows about a vendor that LiteLLM does not.

Any vendor LiteLLM supports already works without an entry here: a key under
its name in ``providers`` plus a "<vendor>/<model>" model id is enough -- the
key reaches LiteLLM as a per-call argument (see ``ProvidersConfig.get``).

Add a ProviderSpec only for what LiteLLM cannot tell us:
  - keywords, so a bare model name ("kimi-k2.5") finds its vendor;
  - default_model / display_name for the wizard and the pickers;
  - a gateway that fronts other vendors (OpenRouter, AiHubMix), an OAuth flow,
    a non-LiteLLM path (Azure), prompt caching, per-model param defaults;
  - a second env var to mirror, or another vendor's driver we are reached through.
A provider's ``name`` IS LiteLLM's spelling for it wherever LiteLLM has one, so
there is one name per provider and nothing to reconcile. A vendor LiteLLM spells
differently is renamed here, with the old spelling kept in ``name_aliases`` so
saved configs keep loading; only a borrowed driver states ``via_driver``.

Order matters — it controls match priority and fallback. Gateways first.
