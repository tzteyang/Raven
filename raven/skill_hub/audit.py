"""Append-only JSONL audit of Hub skill installs.

Every install that passes policy is recorded — both the silent
auto-inject path and explicit ``use_skill`` calls — so an operator can
answer "what third-party code landed on this machine, when, and why".
Best-effort by design: an audit write failure must never take down the
install itself.

Two artifacts with one writer each per install:

- ``installs.jsonl`` (:func:`record_install`) — the append-only fact
  stream, one line per observed install event.
- ``.install-meta.json`` (:func:`write_install_meta`) — a single stamp
  inside the skill directory itself, the O(1) provenance source for
  ``raven skill list`` (no log scan needed). First install wins; later
  observations of the same bundle never rewrite it.
