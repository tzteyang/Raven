"""Safety policy shared by every Hub skill path, at two strengths.

The install strength (:meth:`SkillPolicy.refusal_for_detail`) gates the
two paths that put a body to work — the ``SkillsSegmentBuilder``
post-gate hydrate (auto-inject) and the ``use_skill`` tool - before any
``SkillHubClient.install``:

- the ``score_safety`` bar. Catalog search payloads omit the score, so
  the authoritative check runs on the *detail* metadata (already fetched
  by both paths); a missing score passes to keep score-less deployments
  working.
- the operator blocklist (``skillForge.blocklist``), matched
  case-insensitively against any known identifier of the skill
  (name / slug / native id).
- an external-home-directory lint over the skill body: a hub skill whose
  instructions point at another product's dotdir (``~/.openclaw`` and
  friends) is refused rather than rewritten.
- the ``skillForge.autoInstall`` consent gate over the bundle download
  itself (``auto`` / ``prompt`` / ``off``), consulted right before an
  install would start.

The read strength (:meth:`SkillPolicy.refusal_for_read`) drops the body
lint and keeps the rest. ``read_skill`` installs nothing and hands the
body back wrapped as untrusted data, and the scent menu advertises hub
skills on the identity checks alone — so linting the read too would
recommend skills by id that can never be read.

Stdlib-only on purpose: this module ships with the client when the
package is extracted for reuse outside Raven.
