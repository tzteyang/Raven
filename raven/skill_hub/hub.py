"""The skill hub as an engine: search and detail against the hub; install into and remove from the local pool.

The four operations behind the ``skillhub.*`` RPC methods and behind a plugin
install that carries a skill (``raven.market.install``), together with the
archive safety rules -- member allow-list, size caps, staging directory and
lock -- that make a hub download safe to unpack. Failures are
:class:`SkillHubRequestError` (a request the caller can correct, or a hub answer
that names the problem) and :class:`SkillHubUnavailableError` (raven's own fault or an
unreachable hub); the RPC surface translates them into its own vocabulary.
