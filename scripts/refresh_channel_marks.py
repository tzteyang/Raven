"""Fetch every channel's app mark and write it at the size the channels section draws it.

The channels section of the settings dialog shows each entrance's own app icon
(``ui-web/src/components/ChannelMark.tsx``). Nine of them are the icon the vendor
publishes on its App Store listing, at 512px. That listing is where the five
Chinese apps' colour icons were found: the permissively licensed icon sets
checked (lobe-icons, @cherrystudio/ui, SVG Logos, Simple Icons and the brand sets
on Iconify) carry those five only as single-colour glyphs. The artwork is
resampled here, so a refreshed icon is this script rerun rather than a
hand-edited binary, and ``LICENSES/README.md`` can name where each file came
from. Matrix and MoChat publish a vector mark on their own sites, and those two
are copied byte for byte.
