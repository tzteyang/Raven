/* The page. Every region src/page.html used to carry as markup is rendered
 * from here: the shell's two columns, the module page, the dialog
 * shells, the context menu's rows, the notices, the interiors of the sheets
 * that dock above the composer, and the four layers that belong to no page at
 * all.
 *
 * Every element below is a transcription -- tag, id, class, data-*, role, aria
 * and text exactly as page.html spelled them, attributes in the same order --
 * and the goldens under src/test/__golden__/ are what says so. A region big
 * enough to read on its own gets a file under src/chrome/: the rail, the chat
 * column, the composer dock, the workspace pane, the capabilities page.
 *
 * ONE portal, at the body, and the whole tree inside it. React clears a
 * container it is given as a ROOT -- measured: a root at document.body deletes
 * everything the document was served with on its first commit -- so the root in
 * main.tsx is a detached element and this is a portal into the body it renders.
 * A portal appends, which is what puts these regions after the two shells
 * page.html still carries and before the four runtime layers that are appended
 * during install; state/portals.ts is where that body-level order is declared,
 * because two steps of the `--z` ladder are ties decided by it alone.
 *
 * Language. Each region renders its words through t(key), which reads the
 * language the page resolved before its first frame, and its keyed attributes
 * through lang.attr(key), which is absent until a pick lands -- applyI18n wrote
 * those and it ran only on a pick, so a page nobody has picked for carries none
 * of them (state/lang/store.ts). The key a line speaks is the argument to that
 * call and nothing else. The literals with no key (#cfTitle, #cfYes, #setTitle,
 * #title) have nothing to look up: each is owned by whoever writes it
 * afterwards, and a re-render cannot undo that, because React diffs against the
 * props it rendered last rather than against the document.
 *
 * Flags this renders but does not own, for the same reason: `data-open` on the
 * page and the veils, `data-section` on the settings veil, `hidden` on button#railShow, `data-rail` and
 * `data-page` on div.app, `data-open` / `data-full` on #split, `data-open` on
 * #menu. Each is rendered as the value the page is served with and written
 * afterwards by the one store that owns it (state/page.ts, state/rail.ts,
 * state/ws.ts, state/menu.ts) -- which is also what keeps the order those
 * writes land in. #menu's `left` and `top` are that store's too and are not
 * rendered at all: the menu is placed by measuring it after its rows are in it,
 * which is a value no render could carry.
 *
 * Not here, and not later: #splash and #noJs. Both are pre-JavaScript shells --
 * the splash is the literal first frame, painted while this bundle is still
 * being evaluated, and #noJs is what a reader gets when it never runs -- so
 * neither can be something React puts on screen. They stay in page.html and are
 * taken down at boot (app/splash.ts). #onb stays
 * with them because a portal can only append: rendered from here it would land
 * after #noJs instead of between the two.
