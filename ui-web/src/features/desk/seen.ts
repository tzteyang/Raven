/** Which of each desk tab's items the reader has already seen, per conversation.

Identities, not a count, and the difference is the whole reason this file
replaced the watermark it grew out of. A reader opens ONE of three delivered
files from the conversation's own card, never touching the desk: that file is
not new to them any more, and the shelf has to stop counting it. A watermark --
"the tab held three when you last looked" -- has no way to say WHICH one.
Subtracting one gets the total right by luck and stays wrong: one arrival plus
one read cancel out, and the tab goes quiet holding something unread.

So a tab's news is `its items minus these`, and the two grains fall out of the
same set: looking at a tab marks everything in it, opening one thing marks that
thing. This is also how the demo layer has always counted changes
(`changes.filter(c => !c.seen)`), so the two halves of the page now say it the
same way, and the `Math.max(0, ...)` a watermark needed for a list that shrank
is gone -- a set cannot go negative.

Their own slot rather than a field on the desk's layout note, for one reason
that was a bug first: `remember()` publishes the whole note -- panes, solo,
active, tab -- from whatever the desk holds at that instant, and a mark moves
during a resume, when the desk holds nothing yet and the note is about to be
read. A mark writing through that path landed `open: []` over the panes the
replay was about to restore. A mark is news about a mark; it writes nowhere
else.
