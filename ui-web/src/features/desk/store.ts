 *   look identical in the state -- nothing to show, and standing aside for a
 *   pane -- and answering the first would pull the desk over a file the reader
 *   had just opened. `closePane` states the same rule from the other end.
 * - one direction only. Content leaving is not a reason to take the desk away
 *   from a reader who is looking at it.
