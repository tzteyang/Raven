/** Whether the desk palette is open, remembered per conversation.

The default is not one answer, because the two screens are not one screen: a
conversation shows the desk, and the new-task screen does not. Nothing has been
written, delivered or delegated on a draft yet, so a palette there is three
empty lists over an empty composer -- while a conversation the reader returns to
is exactly where the desk earns its place.

What the reader does themselves outranks both. A collapse is filed under the
conversation it was made in and read back the next time that one is opened, so
the desk stays out of the way where it was put away and stays up where it was
wanted -- rather than one global flag that made the last conversation's decision
for every other one.

`localStorage`, unlike the layout notes in lib/persist.ts: this is a
preference the reader stated, not a record of what was on screen, and it has to
survive the tab being closed to mean what they meant by it.

 * desk AWAY, since cleared and put-away both read as shut and shut is this
 * screen's default. Spent by `adopt` when a draft turns into a conversation,
 * and a conversation started from that screen is exactly what the answer was
 * about.
 *
 * Nothing else spends it, which is the line that matters: a conversation the
 * reader OPENED -- from the rail, by forking, by opening a cron run -- is found
 * as that conversation was left, never as the new-task screen was left. See
 * store.claimDraft.

 *
 * Two things promote now. The first message is one. The other is the roster's

 * matters more there, not less: the reader had it open, and a conversation that
 * arrived because of something they did in it must not arrive with it shut.
 *

 * screen has stated nothing, and writing an implicit answer for them here would
 * file it as a preference -- the conversation would then stay however it looked
 * one second in, for the rest of its life and across reloads. What to do when
