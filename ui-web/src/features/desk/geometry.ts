/* How much of the chat's width the anchored panel is asking for.
 *
 * The transcript column is centred in the chat and the anchored panel hangs into
 * it. Measured on the running page in a 900px-tall window with the default 300px
 * panel, as the intersection of the two rectangles:
 *
 *     1920px   nothing
 *     1600px   13px wide, 330px tall
 *     1440px   93px wide, 330px tall
 *     1280px  173px wide, 330px tall
 *
 * 330px is the panel's own height, so what it covers is a BAND ACROSS THE TOP of
 * the column -- which is where a short conversation's whole content sits, and
 * where any conversation's does once the reader scrolls back up. It does not
 * reach the composer: the panel ends at y=394 and the composer sits near the
 * bottom of the window, so the two intersect on the x-axis only.
 *
 * So the chat gives the width up instead, and the column re-centres in what is
 * left. That is what already happens when the workspace column opens (`--wsw`),
 * which is why it is this shape rather than a nudge holding the column still.
 *
 * All of it or none of it, and the floor is why. Giving up as much as fits and
 * no more sounds gentler and measured WORSE: at 900px it narrowed the column to
 * the 520px floor and the panel still landed 190px into it, leaving 330px of
 * readable width where reserving nothing leaves 342px. So under the floor this
 * answers 0 and the panel overlaps exactly as it does today -- the reserve can
 * improve on that or stand aside, never undercut it.
 *
 * Zero while detached, too: a dragged panel is where the reader put it, and
 * holding a column of space for one floating over the middle of the window
 * would be reserving against a position it no longer has.
