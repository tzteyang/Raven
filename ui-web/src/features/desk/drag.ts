/** What dragging a pane by its header means, decided away from the pointer.
 *
 * Two questions, both pure so the gesture's edge cases are testable without a
 * pointer: which arrangement is the reader proposing by holding a pane HERE,
 * and where would each pane sit under an arrangement. The surface owns the
 * pointer, the lift and the animation; this owns the meaning.
 *
 * The proposal is computed against the panes' CURRENT rects on every move and
 * nothing is rearranged until the pane is dropped -- the drop indicator is the
 * whole preview. Live-reflowing the other panes mid-drag was rejected on
 * purpose: their sizes change across slots (a stacked pane is full-width
 * half-height, a side-by-side one the reverse), and animating a size change
 * under a drag either distorts the content with a scale or re-lays out a
 * conversation's whole DOM every frame. An indicator is a rectangle; it can
 * move at the frame rate whatever the panes hold.

 *
 * Two panes carry the whole vocabulary:
 * - the outer THIRDS of the grid, across the stacking axis, mean "turn the
 *   stack": a stacked pair dragged to the left or right edge becomes
 *   side-by-side with the dragged pane on that side, and a side-by-side pair
 *   dragged to the top or bottom edge becomes a stack. Checked first, because
 *   in a stack every x is inside one pane or the other, and a zone that lost
 *   to the swap test would be unreachable.
 * - the middle of the OTHER pane means "trade places", in either orientation.
 *
 * Three panes and four know only the trade: there is one layout per count, so
 * position is the only thing a drag can change, and the pane under the pointer
 * is the one being displaced.
