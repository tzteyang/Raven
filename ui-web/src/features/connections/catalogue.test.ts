/* Every entrance the channels section lists is named in both locales.

 * The channel catalogue names each row through the shared message catalogue
 * (i18n/messages.json), and a lookup that misses falls back to text rather than
 * failing, so a gap renders as something plausible: a Chinese word in the
 * English slot read as a brand name to an English reader. Held here against the
 * file itself, one entry at a time.
