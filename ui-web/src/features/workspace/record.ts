/* What the workspace panel is a record OF: one row per path the agent
 * rewrote, one row per page it read, and the turn each of them belongs to.
 *
 * Fed from three places that all hand over the same thing -- a tool call and
 * its arguments -- so the rules live once: the live pipeline's `tool.start`
 * and `tool.complete` stages (src/state/session/stages.ts), and the replay of
 * a stored conversation (`wsOnHistory`), which is the same input read back off
 * disk. The arguments ARE the ground truth of an edit: `edit_file` carries
 * old_text and new_text, so the diff needs no backend support at all.
 *
 * The panel chrome around the record -- which view is up, the header badge,
 * the redraw -- is the page's (src/state/ws.ts), not this module's.
