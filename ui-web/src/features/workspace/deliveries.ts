/** The session's delivered files: one registry, two readers.

The rows come from `deliver_files`, which puts its manifest on the tool event's
metadata (`raven_delivery`); a live turn records them as the event arrives and a
reload records them from the replayed history, where the runtime has already
stamped each file with whether it is still on disk.

The registry lives here rather than with either reader because there are two: the
transcript draws the turn's own delivery card, and the desk draws the session's
shelf. It imports nothing from either -- the workspace store parks and restores
it, the transcript writes into it, the desk reads it.

   delivered again took that turn's card away with it (the section, and the
   whole products card when the turn changed no files). Collapsing by path is

   the conversation's card the sub-agent's. The scope is what keeps the two
   apart. It used to be an emptied registry instead, which kept them apart by
   leaving only one of them anything to read: every repaint of a delegated
   stream threw away the deliveries the conversation was still showing.

 * How the session-wide readers -- the shelf and the pane -- order rows they may
 * have taken from different streams. A row from the gateway's registry has no
 * turn, and sorts as older than anything the reader watched arrive, which is
 * what it is: something this conversation delivered, recovered rather than
 * witnessed.
 *
 * `when` is the manifest's own `delivered_at` -- written by the gateway when the
 * delivery happened, in epoch milliseconds UTC, and carried by the identical
 * object down both paths: the live event and the replayed message. So there is
 * one clock here and no inference about where a row came from. Ordering by paint
 * order inverted a lazily replayed history against a newer delivery; ordering a
 * stored stamp against the browser's clock compared two clocks; ordering live
 * above replayed encoded the event source as chronology, and a background
 * sub-agent that delivers later but paints afterwards is exactly the case that
 * breaks. A field written where the delivery happens is the only thing that is
 * none of those.
 *
 * A manifest with no `delivered_at` predates that field and sorts oldest, as does
 * a row recovered from the gateway's registry -- something this conversation
 * delivered, recovered rather than witnessed.
 *
 * Two STAMPED rows can only share a stamp by coming from different producers,
 * since one producer's stamps never repeat. There is no chronological fact left
 * to read then, so the call that made each one decides -- stable, assigned where
 * the delivery happened, and the same answer however the page came to learn of
 * them.
 *
 * Two UNSTAMPED rows are a different case and must not be sorted that way. They
 * are manifests written before the field existed, so a whole legacy history is
 * unstamped, and their call ids carry no order at all -- ranking by them would
 * pick an arbitrary row where replay order at least follows the transcript. They
 * keep arrival, which is what they had.
 *
 * A total order either way: one key per row, compared the same way every time. */
