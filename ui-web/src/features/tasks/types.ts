 * A task is every unit of delegated work the session started: a spawned

 * The wire shapes are `tasks.list`'s own contract types, re-exported here
 * rather than hand-maintained -- see rpc-schema/openrpc.json's `TaskRow` /
 * `TaskNode`; the design is docs/specs/2026-09-18-desk-tasks-list-design.md.
