/* The clarify sheet: the agent asking the reader a question mid-turn.
 *
 * A tenant of the rack, beside the approval sheet and wearing the same clothes
 * -- `.csheet` above the composer, numbered options, a free-text row last. The
 * two are the same kind of interruption (the turn is blocked on the reader), so
 * they interrupt in the same place, and only one of them may be pending in a
 * conversation at a time. That is why the class sweep on the way in is by class
 * rather than by kind.
 *
 * What is here is the sheet's own element and the answers it can give; the
 * markup inside it is features/composer/ClarifySheet.tsx. The element belongs to this
 * module because the rack files it under a conversation and styles it as its
 * flex item -- see that component -- and so do the key handler and the
 * ResizeObserver, which live as long as the question rather than as long as its
 * interior: a parked sheet is unmounted and still pending.
 *
 * The transport stays with the caller. This module raises the sheet and reports
 * one string back -- the chosen option, the typed answer, or the wording of a
 * skip -- and the live layer turns that into `clarify.respond` and marks the
 * step as an exchange. What the reader sees is this module's; what the server
 * hears is not.
