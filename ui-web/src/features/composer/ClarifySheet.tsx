/* The clarify question's interior: the question, the numbered choices and the
 * free-text row the reader answers in -- one question, or a form the reader
 * steps through when the frame brought a whole batch.
 *
 * The sheet element itself belongs to features/composer/clarify.ts, which files
 * it with the rack, decides how many steps there are and holds the document key
 * handler -- so this renders its children and not the container. Two attributes
 * React cannot own on a container it did not create: `data-fold`, which changes,
 * is written here; the rest are set with the element.
 *
 * Nothing is reported until the form is finished. A step keeps what was picked,
 * what was typed and whether it was skipped, so going back to it shows it as it
 * was left, and the last step's Submit reports every step at once. The one
 * exception is the question that is on its own: picking an option answers it,
 * because there is nowhere to go back to and that is what the sheet has always
 * done.
 *
 * The field is uncontrolled and listened to natively, for the two reasons the
 * composer's own field states (features/composer/mount.tsx): a component owning
 * the value re-renders a text field the reader is typing into, and the keydown
 * has to be stopped at the input itself so the page's shortcuts do not read what
 * is being typed. The form is read from and written to state/sheetDrafts.ts on
 * every keystroke and every pick, because the interior is unmounted while the
 * reader is in another conversation and the answers have to survive that.
 *
 * The wording is the opener's: it reads the catalogue once when the question
 * arrives, so a language flip does not re-word a sheet already on screen -- which
 * is what the imperative builder did.
