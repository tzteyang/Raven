// @vitest-environment happy-dom
/* Turning the draft on screen into a real conversation.
 *
 * Two callers depend on this and only one of them is a send: the composer's
 * first message, and the sub-agent roster's new-instance button, which needs a
 * conversation for the instance to live in. The live layer is plain script, so
 * the function is sliced out and driven directly -- the same way
 * `features/rail/session-delete.test.ts` pins its neighbour in this file.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the ORDER, which is the part a reader cannot see and
 * the send silently depends on: the pointer moves, then the caller's hook runs,
 * then the staged settings go up. The hook is where `liveSend` records the
 * turn's owner, and a reader switching conversations inside those round trips
 * would otherwise leave the in-flight turn parked under the wrong one.
