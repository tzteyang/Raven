/* The graphs the page is watching, one per conversation.
 *
 * A `run_subagent_dag` call is the whole picture of a turn's work, and this is
 * where that picture is kept while it moves. The live layer feeds the three
 * `dag.*` events in through mount.ts. Nothing here renders: the trail's
 * delegation card holds its own copy of the same frames, and the graph a
 * reader opens is drawn by the desk's task pane from `tasks.list`. What this
 * answers is session resume, which puts the run back on reload; nothing else
 * reads it today.
 *
 * The runs are shared objects, not copies: the pipeline mutates a node's
 * status and times in place and then calls `touch()`. That keeps the event
 * handlers reading as they did, and keeps one answer to "what is this node
 * doing" rather than two that have to be held in step.
