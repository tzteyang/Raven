/* The three sources a graph reaches the page through, and the merge that lets a
 * card learn from more than one of them.
 *
 * This is where the transcript's dag card and the sheet above the composer agree
 * on what a node is. They used to unpack their payloads separately, and every
 * field one of them forgot was a field that surface could never show whatever the
 * source had -- which is how the card came to hold four of them and no
 * dependencies. So what is worth pinning here is exactly the forgetting: that a
 * source carrying a field produces it, and that a source silent about one does
 * not erase it.
