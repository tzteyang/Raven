/* The three ways a graph reaches the page, adapted to one shape.
 *
 * A `run_subagent_dag` card can learn its nodes from any of three sources, and
 * which one it gets is not a property of the surface drawing it:
 *
 * - the **call's own arguments**, when the model made the call itself. The whole
 *   request is there, inputs and prompt templates included, and it is there
 *   before the run starts;
 * - the **`dag.run_started` event**, when the engine dispatched the run rather
 *   than the model -- a `mode: dag` playbook load, whose arguments are
 *   `{name, params, fills}` and never carried a graph. Structure only: the event
 *   is a run announcement, not a copy of the request;
 * - **`dag.get`**, for a card restored from history whose events are long gone,
 *   and to fill in what the event does not carry.
 *
 * Each surface used to know its own subset of the fields, which is how the
 * transcript's node strip came to hold four of them: a field the adapter did not
 * name was a field the card could never show, whatever the source had. So the
 * adapters live here, next to the model they produce, and a surface asks for
 * nodes rather than reading a payload.
 *
 * `merge` is what makes the sources composable: structure arrives first and the
 * request follows, or the other way round, and neither may erase the other.
