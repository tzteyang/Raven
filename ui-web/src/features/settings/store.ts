/* The settings dialog's state and verbs.
 *
 * Page state, outside React on purpose: three of the callers that drive this
 * dialog are not React. The platform's settings shortcut opens it
 * (state/globalListeners.ts), the whole-page language repaint bumps its epoch
 * (state/lang/effects.ts) and the boot repaints it once the gateway answers
 * (app/boot.ts) -- so the state lives in a plain store those three can call,
 * and the component subscribes.
 *
 * The open section is synced from the shared slot (state/settings.ts) on
 * every draw: the chrome jumps the dialog to a section by writing that slot
 * before asking for the repaint.
