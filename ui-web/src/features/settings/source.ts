/* -- settings: the rpc source -----------------------------------------
   The settings island (ui-web/src/features/settings/) owns the dialog's
   drawing; this module speaks the gateway for it -- settings.*, the provider
   writes the model page makes, the archive's session calls, the skill and MCP
   calls of their two pages -- and holds what one read fills: the raw config,
   where it is on disk, and the EverOS sections. The model half is beside it in
   features/model/source.ts, which this one asks for the provider list and the
   default pair.

   The permission chip's refresh is here too: it mirrors what the gate reads
   for the visible conversation, which is a settings question rather than the
   chip's own. */
