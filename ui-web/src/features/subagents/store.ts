/* What the last paint of this box actually drew.
 *
 * A repaint is not free: the renderer holds a running turn's last assistant
 * message provisionally, and re-feeding it throws that row away and draws it
 * again from the messages. When this guard was written the redrawn row was a
 * new DOM node as well -- measured in the browser against the real renderer,
 * the same snapshot painted three times gave three different nodes for the same
 * sentence -- and each new node ran its entrance animation. The renderer now
 * hands the redrawn row the identity of the one it replaces
 * (transcript/store.ts `adoptIdentity`), so a repaint costs a re-read and a
 * re-render rather than a rebuilt node; an unchanged snapshot still has nothing
 * to pay either for, which is why this stays.
 *
 * The pane repaints every 2s for as long as the instance reads `run`
 * (`InstanceConversation`'s poll effect). A turn that stops producing output
 * without ending -- a tool call that failed and a model that then narrates
 * instead of retrying -- was leaving the last thing it said being rebuilt every
 * two seconds, indefinitely. On screen that was a line of text flickering.
 *
 * So an unchanged snapshot costs no paint. The same rule `refresh` and
 * `refreshInstances` already apply to their own reads, for the same reason and
 * with the same shape: a print of what was drawn, compared before drawing it
 * again. Keyed per box, because two panes can show two instances at once.
