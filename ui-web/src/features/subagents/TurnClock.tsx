/* How long the turn this instance is answering has been running.
 *
 * The same number the main transcript puts beside a running card, in the same
 * spelling (`lib/duration.ts`) and on the same self-stopping clock
 * (`lib/tick.ts`), so a reader who has learned to read one has learned both.
 *
 * The instance's own lifetime would have been the easy number and the wrong
 * one: it is a different fact wearing the same clothes, and a pane header is
 * exactly where the two would be confused. What the server publishes is the
 * turn's start and only while there is a turn -- `turnStartedAtMs` absent is
 * "answering nothing", which is why this draws nothing rather than freezing on
 * a last value when the run ends.
 *
 * Not `updatedAtMs`, which was the tempting field already on the row: every
 * registry write stamps it, so a clock counting from it would jump whenever a
 * binding commit or a graph-origin write touched the record.
