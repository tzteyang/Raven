   `content`; the renderer reads `messages` and `text`. Adapting here keeps the
   renderer the single place transcript rules live, and keeps a future mismatch
   a compile error rather than a panel that silently draws nothing.

   The renderer's `run` status is not decoration: it holds back a trailing
   assistant message while a turn is in flight, so the next read replaces that
   row instead of appending a second copy of it. A `live` turn is exactly that
   state, and the instance's own status is the fallback for a poll landing
