/* One instance's own operating mode: the chip on its pane header.
 *
 * The session tier (`state/tier.ts`) says what raven asks of every sub-agent it
 * dispatches. This says what it asks of THIS one, and the two are a precedence
 * rather than a pair: `SubagentManager.resolve_mode` reads the instance's
 * override, and falls through to the session's tier when there is none.
 *
 * So the default is not a mode -- it is the ABSENCE of one, and the wire says so
 * with `mode: null`. The row for it reads "Auto", and `clear: true` is what puts
 * an instance back on it. `inherited` is the other half of that reply: what a
 * dispatch would actually run at with no override, already clamped to this
 * agent's own rungs, which is the only way "Auto" can say more than "whatever
 * the session says" -- the session's tier may be one this agent cannot rank.
 *
 * The menu is this AGENT's, not the ladder, and it is read from the agent's own
 * ACP handshake rather than assumed. No shipped agent needs that today, which is
 * worth stating plainly: raven-research declares `medium`/`high`/`max` with
 * labels and descriptions of its own, and every other product ships no `modes/`
 * and so inherits raven's built-in three -- so every menu on the current tree
 * spells the ladder. The seam is not decoration, though: a deployment declares
 * whatever vocabulary it likes, `clamp_tier` recognises only the three ladder
 * names, and rendering the ladder here would offer an agent rungs it never
 * advertised and cannot run.
 *
 * Through the shared menu writer rather than a popover of its own: a pane header
 * is not the composer, and the one-line rows the writer draws are what the model
 * chip already uses, trailing tick and all.
