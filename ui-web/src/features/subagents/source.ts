/* What this conversation handed off: the roster, the delegated calls, and the
 * instances a reader can talk to directly.
 *
 * Scoped to the open session on every call, so background work from another
 * conversation can never surface here. Which of them is on screen, when to ask
 * again and whether an answer is worth a repaint are all about what is drawn,
 * and they live with the renderer (ui-web/src/features/subagents/).
 *
 * A server without the surface answers -32601 forever otherwise, and the panel
 * would sit empty with no way to tell an empty list from a missing feature --
 * so an absent surface answers with no rows rather than an error, and `absent`
 * is what the island's empty state reads to tell the two apart.
