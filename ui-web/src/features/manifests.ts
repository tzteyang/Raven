/* Every domain, declared once.
 *
 * What a page IS -- its section id, the box its island fills, the rail button
 * it lights, its place in the Escape chain -- is one table in state/pages.ts,
 * because every table that names a page is the page's own layers reading it.
 * What a domain DOES is here: which page it owns, which seam keys it answers,
 * and the root src/main.tsx mounts for it. Nine of those roots used to be nine
 * copies of `const host = getElementById(...); if (host) createRoot(host)` in
 * main.tsx, and the guard's only reachable effect was an island that silently
 * failed to mount -- an empty page, no error (src/main.tsx says what replaced
 * it).
 *
 * The assembly point rather than a domain: every `features/<domain>/manifest.ts`
 * declares into this file, and no domain may read it -- an import the other way
 * would put every island in every island's closure, which is the shape the
 * island bag had (scripts/gates/import-direction.test.mjs ranks it above the
 * domains for exactly that reason). The per-domain files take `DomainManifest`
 * from here as a type, which erases, so the cycle a reader sees is not one the
 * bundle has.
 *
 * Two fields the plan for this step named are not here yet, and both would be
 * declarations of something untrue today: an `i18n` namespace (measured: no
 * domain's keys live under a single one, and nine share their commonest with
 * another domain -- the rename step is what can declare it) and an
 * `onLangChange` (two domains have an imperative repaint left after the
 * language became a subscription, and state/lang/effects.ts names them by
 * hand because state/ may not import this file).
