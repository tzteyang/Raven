/** Hands an upward overscroll back to the page.
 *
 * A nested scroller inside the transcript carries `overscroll-behavior:
 * contain`, and that is right at its BOTTOM edge: reading a stream to its end
 * should not then carry the whole conversation along with it. At the TOP edge
 * it has nothing to protect and takes something away -- the box is a third of
 * the window tall and the full width of the column, so a reader whose cursor is
 * anywhere over it and who scrolls back up gets nothing at all once the box
 * itself is at the top. The page stays where it is and the surface reads as
 * frozen.
 *
 * CSS cannot say "contain downwards only", and toggling the property from a
 * handler does not work either: the browser reads it when the gesture starts,
 * so a value written mid-gesture applies to the next one, by which time the
 * reader has already seen the page refuse to move. So the containment stays and
 * this hands the upward remainder to the page by hand.
 *
 * By hand means in pixels, which `deltaY` is not always in.
