   posts what is in the field, and only the stored row knows what was there

   answering yes for a write the server settles without asking puts a word on
   something that returns in milliseconds, while answering no for one it does
   ask leaves "connecting" on the row for the length of a real ping. So this
   errs towards yes.

   `migrate` counts because it is a remove plus an add from the preset, so it
   goes through the same gate any other add does. A credential and a model are
