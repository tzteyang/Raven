   Five of these are writes -- the four steps of "connect", plus the switch --

   cancel are the odd pair: they write nothing the reader asked for and answer
   a question instead. They are here rather than on a row for that reason, and
   they live in the card. Remove is still gone with the buttons that named it.
   `model` is the row's own model, set or cleared: an `update` too on the
   wire, kept apart here because its refusal is about the pick, not the row. */
