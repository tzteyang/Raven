/* -- external agents: the rpc source ---------------------------------
   `subagents.*` is one surface shared with the TUI and the web UI: the rows,
   the install grouping and the write path all live server-side, so this module
   only maps a row into what the page draws and sends the mutation back. The
   extAgents island (ui-web/src/features/extAgents/) owns the renderer and
   every flag it reads. It is the seam's one roster source: a page with no
   gateway behind it reads the same calls off the fixture transport.

   The list is re-fetched after every mutation rather than patched locally: the
   handler recomputes `group`, `enabled` and the probe verdict together, and a
   client that guesses any one of them is how the page starts disagreeing with
   the config on disk. `probe: false` on that follow-up call skips the
   availability check, which can cost up to ten seconds per entry and would only
   re-measure what the write just changed. */
