/* The row shape the three set-up-once pages share: sub-agents, entrances,
 * schedules.
 *
 * One shape, so that reading one of those pages teaches the other two. A row
 * answers three questions and nothing else -- who it is, what state it is in,
 * and the one thing to do about it now -- and the whole row is a door to the
 * detail sheet where everything else lives. What used to differ per page (a
 * card here, a tile there, a paragraph of prose under one of them) was a
 * difference in drawing, never in meaning.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to hold:
 *
 * - No prose. A row carries state facts ("ready, verified 3h ago", "2 of 6
 *   credentials"), never an explanation of what the thing is. Descriptions are
 *   editable content and belong in the sheet's own field; a page that prints
 *   them under every row was reading the model's prompt text out loud.
 * - One action. Whichever action the state actually calls for -- install,
 *   connect, test, run -- and never a second one beside it. Destructive verbs
 *   are not row verbs at all: they live in the sheet's overflow menu.
