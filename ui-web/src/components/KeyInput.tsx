/* An API key field: masked by default, with an eye to read back what you typed.
 *
 * Every key in the app goes through here rather than each page spelling out its
 * own `type="password"`. A key is pasted more often than typed and mistyped
 * more often than either, and a field that can never be read is a field you
 * cannot check before pressing Connect -- but one that starts readable puts a
 * credential on screen for anyone walking past. Masked with a way out is the
 * only combination that serves both.
 *
 * A plain input underneath, so a caller keeps handing it a ref and reading
 * `.value` the way it always did.
