/* The detail-sheet anatomy the three set-up-once pages share.
 *
 * Four parts in one order, so the reader learns the shape once:
 *
 *   head        who this is, one line of hard facts, and the overflow menu
 *   state line  what state it is in + the one action that state calls for
 *   content     the fields, or the tabs
 *   foot        whether there is anything unsaved, and one button to save it
 *
 * What this shape is a reaction to: a sheet that had grown into a heap of
 * form. Every field carried a standing hint under it, the description was
 * printed in the head and again in the field, and the verbs were scattered --
 * one in the head, one between two fields, two more in a strip at the bottom.
 * So: no standing hints (a field says what it is by its label; a validation
 * error is the only thing that appears under one), no fact printed twice, one
 * action position for the state, and destructive verbs behind the overflow menu
 * rather than sitting in the page's path.
