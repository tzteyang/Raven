/* What a roster row is allowed to draw, and off which field.
 *
 * The mark is chosen by preset, never by the row's name: a configured row's
 * name is the user's to change, and a hand-written row that merely spells
 * itself `codex` is not Codex. Both halves are pinned here because both have a
 * failure nobody would see in review -- a rename silently losing the brand, and
 * an unrelated row silently acquiring one.
 *
 * `data-tone` is the other half. It says how the file answers the theme, in
 * the three values the stylesheet keys its filters off: absent (every shape
 * carries its own fill, so touch nothing), `mono` (every shape is
 * `currentColor`, which an <img> resolves against its own document and so
 * renders black -- invert the lot), and `hybrid` (some shapes are, so a plain
 * invert would take the brand colour with it). Which file is which is not
 * visible to any DOM assertion -- tests/test_ui_agent_marks.py derives it from
 * the SVG -- so what is pinned is that the value reaches the element that the
 * stylesheet's selector reads.
