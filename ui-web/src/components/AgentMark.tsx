/* Keyed by preset, never by the row's name. What a row draws is a fact about
   the package behind it, and a configured row's name is the user's to change,
   so a renamed row keeps its brand and a hand-written row that merely spells
   itself `codex` gets none -- the boundary ACP_REGISTRY_INSTALL_HINTS draws for
   the same reason.

   Filenames are upstream's, verbatim, so one `cmp` against
   @lobehub/icons-static-svg settles provenance for every file here on the
   terms LICENSES/README.md already records for the provider marks. The one
   exception is miromind.svg, which that package does not carry and which is
   MiroMind's own favicon, also verbatim.

   `tone` says how the file answers the theme, which is a fact about the file
   rather than a preference -- tests/test_ui_agent_marks.py derives each one
   from the shapes in the SVG it names, and the stylesheet reads it back off
   `data-tone`. Three answers, because an <img> resolves `currentColor` against
   its own document rather than the page and so renders it black:

   - absent: every shape carries its own fill. Theme-independent, touch nothing.
   - `mono`: every shape is `currentColor`. Black until the dark theme inverts
     the lot, which is what the provider marks already do.
   - `hybrid`: some shapes are, some are not. Only qoder, whose mark is brand
     green beside one tone the vendor means to follow the page's text -- so a
     plain invert would take the green to magenta with it, and the hue rotation
     puts it back. Measured: #2ADB5C -> #D524A3 inverted, -> #008203 with the
     rotation. Not the same green, and the closest a filter gets without
     constants fitted to one hex; the alternative that reproduces it exactly is
     inlining the file, which ui-web/build.py's assets comment rules out. */

/* Raven's own agents, which carry no preset because there is no third-party
   package behind them to name: `builtin` is this process and `vendored` is a
   Discovered agent under `agents/`. Each is a fact the server asserts about what
   the row runs, exactly as a preset is, so it picks a mark on the same terms --
   and a hand-written row that merely spells itself `Raven-Code` still gets
   none, for the reason the table above is not keyed by name either.

   raven.svg is this project's own mark rather than upstream's, so the `cmp`
   against @lobehub/icons-static-svg that settles provenance for the thirteen
   does not apply to it and LICENSES/README.md counts it separately. It answers
   the theme from a prefers-color-scheme rule inside the file, the way
   miromind.svg does: every shape carries its own fill, so no `tone` filter
   reaches it, and a raven is black -- which on the dark theme's surface is a
   silhouette at 1.2:1, two white eyes floating in an empty frame. */
