/* Turning the draft on screen into a real conversation.
 *
 * Two callers depend on this and only one of them is a send: the composer's
 * first message, and the sub-agent roster's new-instance button, which needs a
 * conversation for the instance to live in. The part is driven as a module,
 * with its collaborators replaced per part and per export
 * (ui-web/scripts/module-harness.mjs) -- so the draft is entered through the real
 * `startDraft` and the promotion is the real one.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the ORDER, which is the part a reader cannot see and
 * the send silently depends on: the pointer moves, then the caller's hook runs,
 * then the staged settings go up. The hook is where `liveSend` records the
 * turn's owner, and a reader switching conversations inside those round trips
 * would otherwise leave the in-flight turn parked under the wrong one. The
 * order is read off the traffic the promotion actually puts on the transport
 * rather than off injected functions: the staged model, tier and permission
 * writes ARE three calls, and a test that watched stand-ins for them could not
 * tell a call that was made from one that was only prepared.
