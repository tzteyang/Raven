/* What a conversation keeps while it is off screen, and what it gets back.
 *
 * Server-side subscriptions are additive and never torn down here, so a
 * background conversation's turn keeps streaming over the socket. The rule is
 * the one the page has always had: a conversation with no turn running keeps
 * nothing -- it is re-read from disk on the way back in -- and one with a turn
 * in flight keeps the turn, the lane it is streaming into, and the frames that
 * arrive while it is away.
 *
 * "Keeps the lane" is a DOM host, not a copy of the segments: the segments are
 * in the transcript store already, and it is the store's lane whose life is
 * tied to that element (features/transcript/mount.tsx). So leaving takes the
 * host off `#stage` and files it on the runtime; coming back puts it back.
