/* Waiting for a new conversation's name, and every way that wait can end.

 * what takes it down, and what the row shows when no generated name arrives --
 * the timer, the three endings the server reports, and the one it cannot.
 *
 * The wait itself stays a `SessionRuntime` field rather than state of this
 * module's own: it belongs to one conversation and outlives a look at another,
 * which is what a runtime is for (state/session/runtime.ts). So this reads the
 * registry for it, and the sends that start a conversation call in here.
 *
 * It writes the title element directly, which the rest of state/ does not: the
 * top bar's heading is markup src/page.html carries, and the skeleton bar that
 * stands in for a name is built here (titlePlaceholder).

/* Naming a new session belongs to the server now: it reads the opening message
   and answers with `session.titled`. Until that lands the row and the top bar
   hold a placeholder, which is what the animation is for -- this used to write
   the truncated first line here and then rewrite it a second later, and no
   client-side cap is left to disagree with the server's.

   The server now says when naming ends without a title
   (`session.naming_ended`), so the ordinary quiet endings settle as fast as a
   success does. This timer is the backstop for the case no message covers -- a
   server too old to send either event, or a connection that drops mid-turn --
   and it outlives the server's own timeout on the call
   (`session_title.timeout_seconds`, 8s by default) so it cannot fire while an
   answer is still legitimately on its way. A placeholder waiting on something
   that is not coming is the one state a reader cannot leave by waiting.

   It gives up onto the opening line held here, NOT onto the stored title: the
   session's auto-name is written by `SessionManager.save`, which runs at turn
   END (agent/loop/main.py), so a turn still working at the 12s mark has no
   stored title to read and the row would sit on the default name until a
   reload -- nothing re-reads it, since `refreshList` fires only for sessions
   the reader is not looking at. The stored read is still tried first, because
   a turn that has already ended has the better text. */
