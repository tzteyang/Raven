/* The conversation: the empty state's flag, the reader's own message, and the

 * The renderer is the transcript island (features/transcript/); what is here
 * is the empty-state flag -- which is a whole layout rather than a message, so
 * it belongs to the chat column -- and the three verbs the session runtime and
 * its stages drive the island by.
 *
 * The flag is written on `.chat` by reaching for that element: the column is
 * the chat's own ground, rendered by src/chrome/ChatTop.tsx's neighbours and
 * owned by nobody who could be handed the flag instead.
