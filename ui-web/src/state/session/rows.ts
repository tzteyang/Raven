/* The conversation list, reached through the seam that answers for it.
 *
 * Four verbs over `sources.rail`, one line each: the rail island renders
 * the rows, the page's boot owns the array behind them (app/boot.ts's
 * sessionsSource), and what is here is what everything else asks of it.
 *
 * `sess` is the fifth, and the reason this is a module rather than four call
 * sites: the pipeline, the registry, the residency rule, the runtime, the
 * language repaint and the boot all turn a session id back into its row, and
 * asking the source for the array on every one of them is what that is.
