/* Putting the page back to what it was showing, one conversation at a time.
 *
 * Each store keeps its own note of what the reader had open (lib/persist.ts);
 * this is the one place that spends those notes, because resuming means asking
 * the gateway what the work looks like NOW and replaying the opens in the order
 * they were made -- and neither of those belongs to any single store.
 *
 * A note is a preference, though, not the price of admission. It is written when
 * a live event is applied, so a conversation whose work began while the reader
 * was in another one has none -- and that is the conversation with the most to
 * put back. The graph half therefore also takes the run ids the caller read off
 * `session.resume`, and asks the gateway even where this page remembers nothing
 * (see `dagToRead`).
 *
 * Called when a conversation is opened rather than at boot, which is a decision
 * and not a convenience. The page boots to the new-task screen on purpose
 * (app/boot.ts), so at startup there is no conversation for a restored
 * sheet to belong to; the rack is session-scoped for the same reason, filing a
 * sheet under the conversation that raised it and mounting it only while that
 * one is open. A reload that gives nothing back until the reader returns to the
 * conversation is therefore the shape the page already has for a session
 * switch, not a new one.
 *
 * Replaying the opens, rather than rebuilding the panes, is what keeps a resumed
 * window honest: it goes through the same verb a click goes through, so it reads
 * its own body from the gateway and lands in the same slot with the same
 * promotion rules.
