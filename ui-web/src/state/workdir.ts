/* The working directory a conversation runs in: the chip on the composer
 * (#wdChip) and the popover it opens (#wdPop).
 *
 * A store rather than a writer, the way perm.ts and tier.ts next door are:
 * <WorkdirChip/> and <WorkdirPopover/> render both nodes from it
 * (src/chrome/WorkdirChip.tsx, src/chrome/WorkdirPopover.tsx). Nothing here
 * reads the document; what stays here is what decides.
 *
 * Two states, and the reader meets them as one control. On a DRAFT the chip is
 * live: the reader picks a folder here, or leaves the default, and the pick is
 * held in this module until the first message mints a session -- the runtime's
 * promotion reads it off `staged()` and hands it to `session.create`, which is
 * the only moment a working directory can be set (raven/rpc/methods/session.py).
 * Held here rather than on the draft runtime because state/session/registry.ts
 * imports the rail's store and the rail's draw repaints this chip: a pick that
 * lived on the runtime would close that ring. IN a conversation the chip only
 * reports: the row's `workdir` names the folder, or the default, and the button
 * is disabled with the path on its title, because the engine cannot move a
 * conversation once it has started.
 *
 * "Default" is the word for no pick, on the chip and in the menu: the engine's
 * policy default is a real place to work, not an absence of one.
 *
 * The menu's recent folders come from the conversations on the rail, deduped
 * in the rail's own order (latest activity first); the browser walks the
 * gateway's `fs.dirs` through the workspace domain's source, and a folder the
 * engine would refuse (the agent's own data, or an ancestor of it) is shown
 * greyed and explained rather than hidden, because the folders under an
 * ancestor may be perfectly good workspaces.
