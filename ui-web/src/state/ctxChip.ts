 *
 * A store rather than a writer, now that <CtxChip/> renders the chip from it
 * (src/chrome/CtxChip.tsx). The showing, the two warmth classes, the dash left
 * to go and the tooltip that doubles as the accessible name were five writes by
 * id here; they are one state read five ways, and the module keeps the pair of
 * numbers they are derived from because nothing else reads those.
 *
 * Hidden until a real window is known. A ring drawn from a guessed denominator
 * is worse than no ring: it looks measured. Until then the two attributes are
 * absent rather than empty -- the page is served with neither -- which is why
 * the tooltip and the offset are nullable here.
