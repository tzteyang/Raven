/* The workspace pane's own state: whether it stands, which view it shows,
 * whether it has taken the window, and how many changed files nobody has read.
 *
 * Four module lets and six verbs, and not to be confused with
 * features/workspace/store.ts, which is the ISLAND: what a view draws inside
 * #wsBody, and the record it draws from (features/workspace/record.ts). What is
 * here is the chrome around that box -- the pane, the tab strip and the two
 * action buttons, which src/chrome/WsPane.tsx renders.
 *
 * The DOM writes stay imperative, and each lands on an element this module is
 * the only writer of:
 *   - #split's data-open and data-full. The grid is where the stylesheet reads
 *     "is the pane up" off (`.split[data-open="true"] #wsBtn{display:none}`,
 *     src/styles/page.css), and it is a container src/page.html still carries.
 *   - #wsBtn's aria-expanded, tooltip and label, and #wsBdg's count. Both are
 *     in the chat header, which is a region of its own.
 *   - #wsWide's four attributes and the tab strip's aria-selected. Those
 *     elements are this region's and the component renders them -- but React
 *     diffs against the props it rendered last rather than against the
 *     document, so an attribute it renders a constant for is one it never
 *     writes again, and keeping the write here keeps each value to one writer
 *     and to exactly the moment it lands today. The tab strip is the one where
 *     that moment is observable: draw() is its only repaint, so a restore that
 *     arrives while the pane is collapsed leaves the strip showing the view it
 *     last drew, and only the next open repaints it.
 *
 * The four facts are exported as bindings as well as through view(), because
 * that is how the three modules that ask "is the pane up" read them -- the
 * arrangement the catalogue's language column already has (src/i18n/t.ts's
 * `code`).
