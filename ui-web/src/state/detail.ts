/* The shared detail drawer: whose card is in it, whether it is up, and the host
 * each island renders that card into.
 *
 * Four islands drew into the same #detail dialog by id -- memory, plugins,
 * skills and extAgents. Each cleared #dBody with innerHTML, blanked #dTitle,
 * wrote data-open for itself, and two of them watched the element with a
 * MutationObserver to learn that one of the others had closed it. The drawer's
 * state was therefore a reading of the DOM, with four writers and no order.
 *
 * It is one store now. An island calls open() and close(), renders into the
 * host handed to it here, and hears about a close through the handler it
 * registers. The two flags are still written imperatively, because aside#detail
 * is rendered with the flag the page is served with and so is not
 * React's to render; #dBody's child list is one host per owner, which React
 * never reconciles either. What IS React's is the interior App.tsx renders --
 * #dTitle's text and the close button.
 *
 * Close order is a contract rather than an accident: CLOSE_ORDER declares it --
 * plugins, then skills, then the base flag write, with the two observers
 * following in a microtask after all of it -- because registration order is
 * module evaluation order, which is not something this contract should rest on.
