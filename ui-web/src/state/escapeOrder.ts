/* What Escape takes back, and in which order.
 *
 * Fifteen layers can be on screen at once, and one key closes one of them.
 * Which one was a fourteen-branch if chain in the page's chrome: a list of
 * selectors read top to bottom, each branch returning so the ones below it
 * never ran.
 *
 * It is an ordered table here, and a table rather than a stack on purpose. A
 * stack would close whatever was raised last, and the chain's order is not
 * that order: the channel dialog opens over the entries page and closes first,
 * but the shared drawer opens over the dialog and closes second -- the comment
 * beside branch three said so in as many words. Each entry answers "am I open"
 * when the key arrives, so nothing here remembers a sequence.
 *
 * `id` is the text the chain tested, which is what the gate on this order
 * compares against (escapeOrder.test.ts): a selector for the twelve layers with
 * an element, the predicate's own name for the two without one. `isOpen` is that
 * same test -- the attribute for the twelve, because that is what the chain
 * read and what the four islands and three stores that raise them write, and
 * the module's own answer for the settings dialog, which has been a flag in
 * state/settings.ts since C4, and for the running turn.
 *
 * The three capture-phase handlers each open sheet registers run before this
 * table and two of them act on Escape without stopping propagation, so one
 * Escape can both deny an approval and interrupt the turn behind it. That is
 * the behaviour, not an accident of where the listener sits.
