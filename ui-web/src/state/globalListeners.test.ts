// @vitest-environment happy-dom
/* The order the page registers its document- and window-level listeners in.
 *
 * Five of them are capture-phase and read an event before the element the
 * reader touched ever sees it, and inside one phase the first handler
 * registered runs first -- so this sequence decides, for every pair of
 * listeners that answer the same event, which one answers it first. It used to
 * be an accident of which module main.tsx called first; the table below is
 * what it is instead.
 *
 * The recorder replaces addEventListener rather than wrapping it, so nothing is
 * left registered on the document afterwards and the cases can run in any
 * order. It also sees only what installGlobalListeners() itself registers,
 * which is what the case is about: the three registrations the page makes that
 * are NOT product code -- react-dom's own probe and its selectionchange, both
 * from the first createRoot, and happy-dom's resize listener behind
 * matchMedia -- are made outside this call and are not in the table.

/* One row per listener: target, event, phase, the handler itself where another
   module owns it, and who it belongs to in words.
   The handler is in the row rather than in a second table keyed by position:
   the old one held `[1, browser.trap] ... [21, updates.onVisible]`, so
   inserting a listener renumbered every row below it and the two tables could
   disagree about which row was which. Four handlers are this module's own and
   cannot be named from outside -- the popover arbitration, the code-block copy,
   the Escape chain and the settings shortcut -- and those four are what the
   order pins instead, together with the source-text case in
   state/escapeOrder.test.ts that holds every keydown the page installs to the
   bubble phase.

   Identity, not shape, because two rows of the same shape are the pairs that
   matter most: which of the two capture-phase pointerdown listeners closes
   first, and which of the two capture-phase scroll listeners reads first, are
   decisions no (target, type, phase) triple can tell apart. */
