/* Whether the rail stands or is collapsed.
 *
 * Three writes and no state was all this used to be, so "is the rail open" was
 * readable only by asking the DOM what
 * `.app` carried -- which is what the keyboard shortcut for the rail did, and
 * why it reads the flag here instead now.
 *
 * The three writes stay, because none of the elements they land on belongs to
 * the rail's own markup: `.app` and `<html>` are the grid and the root that the
 * stylesheet reads the state off (`.app[data-rail="off"] .rail{display:none}`,
 * src/styles/page.css), and button#railShow is a top-level region of its own.
 * All three are rendered by src/App.tsx with the value the page is served with
 * and never written by it again -- React diffs against the props it rendered
 * last rather than against the document -- so one value keeps one writer, and
 * this is it.
 *
 * Not here: the rail's WIDTH, which is a drag rather than a state
 * (src/chrome/behaviour/panes.ts), and the session list inside it, which is an island
 * (src/features/rail/).
