/* The sheet rack: session-scoped bookkeeping for everything that docks above
 * the composer.
 *
 * State rather than a writer, for the reason `state/lightbox.ts` states -- one
 * node appended to a host is a writer, a container plus a list is not -- and
 * the list is what is here: which conversation each sheet belongs to, what it
 * renders, and who is waiting on the reader. The rack it fills (`#sheetRack`)
 * sits inside `.dock`, one node above the composer card in the same markup, and
 * every mutation here still ends in `dockLift()`, which is the composer's.
 *
 * A sheet's own element is the host its tenant hands over, not something React
 * renders: `.dock .sheets > *` styles that element as the flex item and
 * `data-sess` is written on it, so a wrapper around it would take both.
 * The interior is a component (src/chrome/SheetRack.tsx portals each view into
 * the host it belongs to), so this module keeps the DOM order it always had:
 * newest first, the same insertBefore, and the caret undisturbed by a sync.
 *
 * What docks here -- a clarify question, an approval request -- belongs to the
 * conversation it was raised in. Each used to be appended
 * straight into `.dock-in`, which is one element for the whole window, so
 * switching sessions left another conversation's question sitting over the
 * composer: still answerable, and answering it replied on behalf of a turn the
 * reader was no longer looking at.
 *
 * A sheet is filed under a session key on arrival and mounted only while that
 * session is open. Detached rather than destroyed, and the element is kept: the
 * question is still pending on the server, so coming back has to show the same
 * sheet -- not a fresh one that replays its entrance. Its interior is unmounted
 * while it is parked, which is why what the reader typed into it lives in
 * state/sheetDrafts.ts rather than in the input.
 *
 * A detached sheet's document-level key handler is still live, which is the one
 * thing this scoping does not fix on its own. Each handler checks
 * `sheet.isConnected` for that reason: otherwise "1" typed in one conversation
 * would answer a question waiting in another. Unregistering it when the sheet
 * leaves for good is the rack's job, through the teardown below.
