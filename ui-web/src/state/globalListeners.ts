/* Every listener the page holds on the document or the window, in one place.
 *
 * They used to be spread over ten modules, each registering its own from its
 * own install(), and the order they ended up in was an accident of which file
 * main.tsx called first. That order is a
 * contract, not an accident: five of them are capture-phase and run before the
 * element the reader clicked ever sees the event, and inside one phase the
 * first handler registered runs first. So the popover arbitration closes the
 * two composer popovers only after the menu writer has closed the menu, the
 * chips answer Enter before the Escape chain does, and the link trap reads a
 * click before the transcript can.
 *
 * Hence one function: the sequence below IS the page's listener order, read
 * top to bottom, and src/state/globalListeners.test.ts asserts it call for
 * call. Element-level listeners are not here -- a control's own handler
 * belongs with the control (a component's ref, or the module that draws it) --
 * and neither is anything registered when an overlay opens (each docked sheet
 * adds a keydown of its own, and takes it away again).
 *
 * One line below is not a registration: the hover pill's layer is raised here,
 * beside the listeners that drive it, because the pill's store owns no install
 * of its own and the layer has to stand at the body before the first hover.
 * WHERE it stands among the body's children is state/portals.ts's to decide.
