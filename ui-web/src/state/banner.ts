/* The strip above the transcript (#bannerHost): at most one standing notice
 * about something the reader has to act on outside this conversation.
 *
 * Which notice stands is state here, and <Banner/> (src/chrome/Banner.tsx) is
 * the pair of shapes it picks between. The decision stays in `draw` rather than
 * moving into the render for two reasons: it is a priority rather than a
 * composition, and it consults the capability list -- a read that throws when
 * the seam is not installed, which the caller has to hear about and a render
 * must not make.
 *
 * Order is the whole design: a memory fault beats a missing capability,
 * because a backend that stopped storing has been handing back normal-looking
 * replies the whole time, while an unconfigured search has been visibly
 * refusing. Whichever wins draws alone.
 *
 * `draw` commits synchronously: it is the statement the caller's next line
 * reads the page after.
