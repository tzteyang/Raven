/* The one context menu shared by rows and action buttons across the page.
 *
 * What is here is the menu's state -- which host it was raised in, and the rows
 * it was raised with -- plus the two things that are not rendering: the flag and
 * the position on the host element, and the pointerdown that closes it from
 * anywhere on the document. The rows themselves are rendered by <ContextMenu/>
 * (src/App.tsx) into div#menu, a standing host that root renders.
 *
 * `show` still commits synchronously, because the position is measured from the
 * menu AFTER its rows are in it: the clamps below keep the last row and the
 * right edge inside the viewport, and a menu measured before it had rows would
 * be placed as if it were empty.
 *
 * The host is the element found when the menu was raised, and the row that is
 * picked closes THAT element -- not whatever #menu answers with later. A test
 * pins the difference, and the reason it is worth pinning is that the menu
 * outlives the host in exactly one case: a page region redrawn under an open
 * menu leaves the rows the reader is pointing at in a detached host, and
 * closing the new one instead would leave those rows on screen.
