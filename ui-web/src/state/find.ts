/* The session search row (#findBox in the markup): the term, and whether the
 * row is showing.
 *
 * Two facts and no DOM, now that <FindRow/> renders the row from them
 * (src/chrome/Rail.tsx): the row's `hidden`, the clear button's `hidden` and
 * the search button's `aria-expanded` are the same state read three ways, and
 * they used to be three writes by id here -- which also meant "is the row
 * open" was answerable only by asking the box what it was hiding.
 *
 * The field itself stays out of React's hands, and that is the reason this is a
 * store rather than an island: a component owning #sfind would re-render a text
 * field the reader is typing into. So `install()` puts the field's three
 * listeners on it natively -- input, keydown, blur -- and the two buttons beside
 * it call in from their own onClick. The listeners have to be native rather than
 * React's for a second reason as well: `input` and `blur` do not bubble, and the
 * Escape key is stopped here so that the document's chain does not also take a
 * panel down (see below).
 *
 * The term used to be a page global the chrome wrote and the rail's snapshot
 * carried back in. It is neither now: it lives here, and the rail asks for it
 * through term() below -- a direct read inside one bundle, not a seam. A seam
 * would mean the demo and live layers each having to answer for a value only
 * this module can produce, which is exactly the coupling the DataSource seam
 * exists to retire.
 *
 * The rail installs the redraw callback from the bundle entry point. Its own
 * live-boot hold decides whether that means rows or skeletons.
