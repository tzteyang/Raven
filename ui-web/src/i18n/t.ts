/* The message catalogue and the text the page renders from it.
 *
 * One file feeds both front ends: i18n/messages.json is what the TUI generates
 * its own copy from, so one edit moves both. The lookup falls back in one
 * chain -- the entry in the current language, then its English, then the
 * caller's fallback, then the key itself -- so a key the catalogue never grew
 * still renders as something rather than as nothing.
 *
 * The language is module state rather than a parameter because every caller has
 * always meant "the current one". `code` is which column of the catalogue to
 * read, and src/state/lang/store.ts is its only writer: that module resolves the
 * page's language before the first frame and moves this column with it.
 *
 * `t` is the whole of what the page calls. The lookup itself is module-private,
 * because `t` is the same lookup behind one indirection and that indirection is
 * the seam a case replaces (`setTranslator`): a caller that reached for the raw
 * lookup was a caller a case could not stand in for, and two names for one
 * question is one too many.
