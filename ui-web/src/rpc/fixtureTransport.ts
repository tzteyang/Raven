/**
 * A contract answer as a gateway really sends it: a field the contract leaves
 * optional may carry `null`, which is the wire saying nothing.
 *
 * The contract says so in prose where its schemas cannot -- a playbook node's
 * `skills` is three-state ("null means the author said nothing"), and a cron
 * job with no next fire sends `next_run_at_ms: null`
 * (raven/rpc/methods/console.py) against a schema that types the field as an
 * integer. So a responder answering exactly what the server answers could not
 * be held to the generated type as generated, and seven of them were built
 * behind an `as` instead -- which switches off the whole check, required fields
 * and enums included, for the sake of one optional field.
 *
 * This widens only that: required fields, enums and nested shapes are held
 * exactly, and a required field a fixture omits is a compile error again.
 * scripts/gates/fixture-shape.test.mjs reads a null on an optional field as an
 * absence for the same reason.
