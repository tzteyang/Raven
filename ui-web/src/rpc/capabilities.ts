/* Where "this gateway is older than this page" is decided.
 *
 * Two different questions used to be answered in eleven scattered places.
 *
 *   - A METHOD the gateway does not serve AT ALL. It answers -32601 and the
 *     page must stop asking: `gone()` records the name, `has()` reads it back.
 *     That set used to be private to the browser's own transport code, which
 *     is why three other callers had to go through it to ask about
 *     sub-agents.
 *   - A FIELD an older gateway does not carry. Each is one condition at one
 *     site. Every one of them is named below and moved here unchanged, so the
 *     tolerances read as a list instead of being found by grep.
 *
 * `system.hello` is the third source and the coarsest: `server_capabilities`
 * announces "jsonrpc-2.0", "subscriptions" and "cli-dispatch" and nothing
 * finer (raven/rpc/methods/system.py), so `absorb()` records it and `serves()`
 * reads it -- and none of the field questions below can be answered from it.
