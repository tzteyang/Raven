/* The offline library: one wire answer per method the page asks for.
 *
 * This is what `?stub=1` and a page opened from disk run on. It replaced a
 * second data layer -- twenty fixture sources on the seam, each in its
 * island's own shape -- with responses in the contract's shape behind the one
 * transport, so the offline page and the
 * live page are the same program with a different socket. A field the contract
 * requires and a fixture omits is a compile error here, and a page that draws
 * the wrong thing offline is drawing the wrong thing live.
 *
 * That first claim was false for seven of these responders, which built their
 * answers behind an `as` -- and an assertion switches off the whole check, not
 * the one field it was reached for. They are annotated now, and what an
 * offline answer is held to is `Wire<ResultOf<M>>` (../fixtureTransport.ts):
 * the contract exactly, but with the nulls a gateway really sends where the
 * contract leaves a field optional. The two halves of "optional" that tsc
 * cannot see -- a field the contract declares and nothing here ever sends --
 * are pinned in scripts/gates/fixture-shape.test.mjs.
 *
 * Every time value comes from the injected clock, so two passes over the
 * library answer byte-identically
 * (ui-web/scripts/gates/fixture-now.test.mjs), and the scripted conversations
 * push their frames on the injected timer.
