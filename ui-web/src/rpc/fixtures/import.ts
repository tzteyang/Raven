/* The cold-start import, canned: what a scan finds on a machine that has run
 * Claude Code and Hermes, and an import that finishes a few seconds after it
 * starts -- the message pass, then the two phases behind it.
 *
 * Every platform the importer knows is listed, the way the gateway lists them;
 * the two with scanners carry counts, the rest say so. The run's progress is
 * scheduled on the injected clock so two libraries answer the same bytes. A
 * full import lets one Hermes conversation fail, so the finished row has a
 * failure to show; a stop mid-run leaves the counts short, which is the row
 * the rail draws as paused.
