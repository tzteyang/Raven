/* Which transport this page talks to, and what is layered over it.
 *
 * One decision, made once, before anything can ask for a gateway. It used to be
 * two: a URL test that decided whether the live half of the page script
 * installed at all (`liveMode`), and a demo layer that registered twenty
 * fixture sources when it did not. The page is one program now -- every feature
 * reads its own `source.ts`, every source speaks the contract -- so the only
 * thing left for the URL to decide is what answers those calls.
 *
 *   - served over http(s) without ?stub=1  ->  the WebSocket to a real raven
 *   - opened from disk, or with ?stub=1     ->  the offline fixture library
 *
 * The two canvases are overrides on top of whichever of those was chosen, so
 * both work on a live page as well as an offline one -- `?desk-demo=1` has
 * always been applied on the live page, and `?onboard=demo` is a first-run flow
 * that writes nothing, which is exactly what there was no way to look at
 * against a real serve before.
