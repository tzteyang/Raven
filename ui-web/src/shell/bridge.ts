/* The strangler seam between a migrated island and the legacy shell.
 *
 * The shell publishes late-bound closures on window.RavenShell (see
 * ui-web/src/demo/155-bridge.js): late-bound so the live layer's rebinds --
 * toast, most notably -- win over the demo definitions the bridge was
 * evaluated with. window.DS is the DataSource seam object itself, published
 * by ui-web/src/seam/000-datasource.js.
 *
 * Everything here throws loudly when the shell is absent: an island runs
 * inside the assembled page or inside a test that installed fakes, never
 * standalone, and a silent fallback would just move the failure downstream.
