/* The gateway connection as the reader sees it, and the two handshakes this

 * The socket, the pending calls, the rejoin and its backoff all live in the

 * gateway before anything asks for one. What is here is everything that
 * PAINTS -- the reconnect status line, the upgrade shade, the auth banner --
 * driven off the transport's own connection state, plus the desktop shell's
 * `ready` and `reauth` messages, because the shell is the other end of both
 * the splash and the credential this page cannot mint.
 *
 * It asks the document for `.upshade` because "is a card already up" is a
 * question about the whole page: the one an upgrade this page started built
 * belongs to that watcher, which is still writing into it.
