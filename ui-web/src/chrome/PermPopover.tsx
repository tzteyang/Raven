/* The permission popover: the three tiers, as a radio group over the composer.
 *
 * WHERE this renders is the one thing it does not decide. The popover is a child
 * of the composer card here, which is where the page is served with it, and
 * state/perm.ts's open moves the node to the body the first time it opens --
 * once, and never back: the card's entrance animation makes the card a
 * containing block, which re-bases the popover's position: fixed against the card
 * instead of the viewport. React renders on into a child it no longer holds,
 * because none of the card's children is conditional and it therefore never
 * reconciles that child list (src/chrome/Dock.tsx).
 *
 * The rows go in through a portal into #permList, though #permList is rendered
 * right here, and that is what makes them clickable: React delegates a click
 * from the container it rendered a tree into, and by the time there are rows to
 * click the popover has left that container for the body. Measured -- a row's
 * onClick simply stops firing. A portal makes the list its own container, and
 * the list travels with the popover.
 *
 * The rows themselves are the store's, words and tick and all, read when the
 * popover opened rather than while it stands: a language applied over an open
 * popover left the rows in the language they were built in, and a pick left the
 * tick on the tier that was in force when they were built. Both are reproduced
 * by rendering the list the open took.
 *
 * The heading and the note carry keys, so each reads the catalogue as it
 * renders (t(key)), in whichever language the page resolved.
