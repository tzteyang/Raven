/* The workspace pane: the column src/page.html used to carry as markup beside
 * the chat.
 *
 * One file per region of the page, under src/chrome/ -- beside src/features/
 * (islands, each with its own root and its own data), src/state/ and src/chrome/behaviour/ (the modules that own
 * listeners and measurements rather than markup).
 *
 * Every element below is a transcription -- tag, id, class, data-*, role, aria,
 * the svg path data and the text exactly as page.html spelled them, attributes
 * in the same order -- and src/test/__golden__/region-app.txt is what says so.
 * The column itself is here too now: src/App.tsx renders it as one of the two
 * children of #split.
 *
 * Words go through t(key), which reads the language the page resolved before
 * its first frame (state/lang/store.ts); the key each line speaks is the
 * argument to that call.
 *
 * What this does NOT own, though it renders the elements:
 *   - #wsBody's children. It is shared ground for three islands: the workspace
 *     view roots itself in it, and the browser and sub-agent views are handed
 *     the cleared box (features/workspace/store.ts's mount), so React must not
 *     own that child list.
 *   - the tab strip's aria-selected and #wsWide's four attributes, which the
 *     pane's state writes at the moment it decides them (src/state/ws.ts).
 *   - #wsUnseen's count, written with the header badge's by the same bump, and
 *     #wsAgentRun's dot, which the sub-agents island raises
 *     (features/subagents/store.ts).
 * Each of those is still exactly one writer of the value it writes, and React
 * cannot undo any of them: it renders each as the constant the page was served
 * with, and it diffs against the props it rendered last rather than against the
 * document, so a value it never changes is a value it never writes again.
 *
 * Two controls the pane drives are not its own markup, so it binds them by id:
 * the toggle in the chat header (#wsBtn, a region of its own) and the keyboard
 * shortcuts, which are on aside.ws itself.
