/* The model chip in the bar under the field: the provider's mark, the model's
 * display name and a chevron saying a list opens here.
 *
 * Rendered from two stores rather than written by id, which is what the chip
 * was before: the model store says which model this conversation runs on
 * (features/model/store.ts), and features/model/chip.ts's `paint` is bumped by
 * every path that changes what the chip should say without changing the model
 * -- a provider refresh, a language pick -- so the label reads the provider
 * list as it stands. The full id stays on the title, because the row is 12px
 * type with an icon in it and the reader who needs the exact string hovers.
 *
 * The display name is the registry's label where the provider carries one,
 * and the id without its vendor half otherwise -- the same rule the picker's
 * rows follow, so the chip and the row it was picked from say the same thing.
 *
 * The click is the chip's: the picker against the provider list the page
 * really has, and a build with no provider configured is sent to Models first,
 * which is what that guard answers.
