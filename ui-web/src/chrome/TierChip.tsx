/* The sub-agent effort chip, beside the model chip and deliberately not inside
 * its picker: a tier is not a model. It moves what raven asks of the sub-agents
 * it dispatches, and leaves raven's own effort alone.
 *
 * Served hidden, and shown once a catalogue has answered -- a build can offer
 * none, and then the chip stays hidden rather than drawing a control over
 * nothing. All of that is state/tier.ts's `paint`: `off` while there is no
 * honest tier to name, and the bars, the name and the accessible name when
 * there is. The three are read only while it is on, which is what keeps the
 * served literals under a hidden chip instead of a tier this side invented.
 * aria-expanded is the popover's, and so is the click.
