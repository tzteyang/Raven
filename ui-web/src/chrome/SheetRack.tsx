/* The interiors of the get docked above the composer.
 *
 * One portal per sheet, into the sheet's own element rather than into
 * `#sheetRack`, and that is the whole of the arrangement. Three things ask for
 * it. `.dock .get > *` styles a sheet as the rack's flex item and the rack
 * writes `data-sess` on what it is handed (src/styles/page.css:4385-4393), so a
 * sheet cannot be wrapped. A portal appends its children to the container it is
 * given, so a portal into `#sheetRack` would put a question under whatever
 * docked before it instead of over it. And the order
 * the rack keeps is "newest first" with the caret left alone on a sync, which is
 * an insertBefore the store already does node by node.
 *
 * So the rack resolves `#sheetRack` when a sheet docks, which is also what makes
 * this indifferent to whether that element is page.html's or React's.
 *
 * Only the open conversation's get are here: a parked sheet's interior is
 * unmounted, and what the reader typed into it is in state/sheetDrafts.ts. The
 * host element itself is kept by the store, so coming back re-fills the same
 * sheet rather than replaying its entrance animation.
