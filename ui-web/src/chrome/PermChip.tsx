/* The permission chip in the bar under the field, and the click that opens its
 * popover.
 *
 * The whole of it is the store's now: the tier's name, its shield, the warning
 * class and the accessible name are one `paint` field state/perm.ts fills in
 * its draw, and aria-expanded is the popover's up-or-down. The four used to be
 * written by id over what this rendered.
 *
 * Until that first draw the chip shows the shape the page is served with -- the
 * plain shield and the served word -- because that is what the region golden
 * records and what a reader sees for the frame before the boot's list runs.
 * The accessible name is the one value with no served form: the page carries no
 * aria-label here, so this renders none until there is a tier to name.
 *
 * The icon goes in as markup because that is how the store spells it: one
 * string of paths per tier, which is also how the popover's rows carry theirs.
 *
 * The click is the chip's and not the chrome's. It toggles rather than opens,
 * because the popover has no close button of its own and the chip is the only way
 * back out of it with the pointer.
