/* The chat column's chrome above the dock: the session header, the scroller's
 * three grounds, the back-to-bottom pill's glyph and the wordmark -- four
 * regions src/page.html used to carry as markup.
 *
 * One file per region of the page, under src/chrome/, beside src/features/
 * (islands), src/state/ and src/chrome/behaviour/ (the modules that own
 * listeners and measurements rather than markup). Every element below
 * is a transcription -- tag, id, class, data-*, role, aria, the svg path data and
 * the text exactly as page.html spelled them, attributes in the same order --
 * and src/test/__golden__/region-app.txt is what says so. The containers are
 * here too now: src/App.tsx renders div.chat and this is the first five of its
 * six children, with the composer dock (src/chrome/Dock.tsx) sixth.
 *
 * What this does NOT own, though it renders the elements:
 *   - h1#title's text. Seven modules write it -- features/rail/source.ts and
 *     store.ts when a row is renamed, state/session/registry.ts and runtime.ts
 *     as a conversation opens, loads and streams -- and features/rail/store.ts
 *     swaps the whole heading for an input while the reader renames it. The
 *     literal here is what the page is served with and this never changes it,
 *     so React never writes it again: it diffs against the props it rendered
 *     last rather than against the document.
 *   - #wsBtn's aria-expanded, and #wsBdg's count and hidden (state/ws.ts's
 *     setOpen and bump). Its tooltip and label have two writers, which is the
 *     behaviour: state/ws.ts names them for the state the pane is in, and the
 *     keyed value below is written on a language pick -- so a pick puts the
 *     word for "expand" back on an open pane's toggle, exactly as the document
 *     pass did.
 *   - #backpill's hidden, tooltip and label, and its click
 *     (features/composer/store.ts's pillPaint, features/composer/mount.tsx).
 *   - #flash and #stage's children. #stage is shared ground: the transcript
 *     island appends a lane host into it and the composer appends the live
 *     turn's, each keeping its position by identity, so React owning that child
 *     list would tear both out.
 *   - #wsGrip, which has no interior at all, so nothing portals into it.
