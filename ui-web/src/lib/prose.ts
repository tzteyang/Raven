       mathematics, which is a sentence models write far more often than they
       write a formula. The leading character is matched rather than looked
       behind, and handed back, so the shipped pass needs no lookbehind. The
       dollar is a character class rather than a backslash escape on purpose:
       escaped, it is immediately followed by the group's paren, and those two
       characters together are the page's own "reach for an element" helper.
