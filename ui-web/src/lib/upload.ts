 * and putting one there is a contract change this does not need.
 *
 * Why the page refuses an oversized upload instead of letting the server say
 * no: the bytes ride as base64 inside ONE JSON-RPC frame, so a file over the
 * limit builds a frame over the socket's own ceiling, and the transport closes
 * the connection before `fs.upload` is ever called. That reached the reader as
 * a reconnect and took every other in-flight call on the socket down with it.
 * Refusing here turns it into a sentence about the file.
