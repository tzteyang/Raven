/* Everything that sits at the body rather than inside a page, and the order it
 * sits in.
 *
 * One step of the `--z` ladder in src/styles/page.css is a deliberate tie --
 * `--z-shade` with `--z-tip` at 90 -- so for those two elements the DOM order
 * at the body is the whole of the stacking decision. The order is declared in
 * src/state/portals.ts, which is also what hands out the four standing layers,
 * and if that table says one thing while the page does another the tie flips
 * with no test and no pixel to catch it. This file reads the table against the
 * page: the boot goldens, the markup, the popover that stays in its card, and
 * the body while every overlay is up. The table's own accessor has its own
 * test beside it (src/state/portals.test.ts).
