/* Everything that sits at the body rather than inside a page, and the order it
 * sits in.
 *
 * Two steps of the `--z` ladder in src/styles/page.css are deliberate ties --
 * `--z-shade` with `--z-tip` at 90, and `--z-picker` with the inline 46 the two
 * composer popovers set -- so for those four elements the DOM order at the body
 * is the whole of the stacking decision. The order is declared in
 * src/state/portals.ts, which is also what hands out the four standing layers,
 * and if that table says one thing while the page does another the ties flip
 * with no test and no pixel to catch it. This file reads the table against the
 * page: the boot goldens, the markup, the two popovers that reparent
 * themselves, and the body while every overlay is up. The table's own accessor
 * has its own test beside it (src/state/portals.test.ts).
