// @vitest-environment happy-dom
/* A golden per top-level region of the page, taken from the markup that ships
 * today.
 *
 * Every one of these regions moved out of src/page.html and into App.tsx, one
 * step at a time. The promise was that the DOM does not move:
 * an element's tag, id, classes, data-* attributes and the order of its children
 * all stay as they are. So the golden was written once, here, off page.html --
 * and each step changed only where the test got the markup from, never the
 * golden text. A region whose owner changed and whose shape changed with it
 * fails on the region it broke, by name.
 *
 * All but three are App.tsx's now; page.html carries the two pre-JavaScript
 * shells and the onboarding host. The markup is read and parsed
 * rather than booted: no script runs, so what is pinned is the skeleton the
 * document is served with, before any island or writer has touched it -- plus
 * the page's own root, which renders synchronously in main.tsx and is the rest
 * of that skeleton. The boot-time shape has its own gate
 * (scripts/boot-snapshot.mjs) and the body's standing order has another
 * (portals.test.ts).
