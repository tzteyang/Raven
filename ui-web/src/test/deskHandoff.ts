/* The two hand-offs src/main.tsx makes, for a case that drives the desk.

 * features/desk/store imports both of the stores below back and

 * hands the desk's three openers over instead (setAgentPane, setDeskOpener). A
 * case that replays an open into a pane needs the same wiring, and reaching for
 * the page's entry point is not open to it -- src/main.tsx is the whole page.
