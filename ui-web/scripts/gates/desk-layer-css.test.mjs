/* The three layers a drag puts on the desk, in the order a reader needs them.
 *
 * The resting panes are the ground, the drop indicator draws on top of them --
 * it is the answer to "where would this land" and is worthless behind the thing
 * it is answering about -- and the pane in hand rides above both.
 *
 * That order only holds while a pane's INSIDE cannot reach the grid's layers.
 * A pane's composer carries the page composer's own `.dock` z-index of 5, and
 * with no stacking context on the pane that 5 was measured against the grid:
 * it beat the indicator's 3, and dragging over a sub-agent's window drew the
 * target rectangle behind that window's composer. No DOM test can see this --
 * paint order is not in the DOM -- so the stylesheet is where it is pinned.
