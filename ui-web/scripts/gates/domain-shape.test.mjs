/* Every domain has the same files, and each of them means one thing.
 *
 * `features/<domain>/` is where a person adding a feature starts, and what they
 * find there is what they copy. The four below are the shape the tree already
 * mostly has -- the contract types, everything the domain knows about the
 * gateway, its state, and the one declaration the page reads it through -- plus
 * a root component for every domain the page mounts as one piece. Nothing
 * enforced it, so one domain's source lived in another's directory and one had
 * no declaration at all.
 *
 * A ratchet in the house style: EXCEPTIONS is what the tree holds today, one
 * reason per missing file, and it may only shrink. A new domain has them all.
