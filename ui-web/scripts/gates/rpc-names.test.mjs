 * this is what keeps it to the two names it was opened for. They answer -32601
 * today and must go on doing so rather than being typed into existence or
 * silently dropped -- a misspelt name is a -32601 at the moment a reader opens
 * the page that makes it. The names are collected from the source with the
 * TypeScript API (scripts/gates/rpcCalls.mjs, which offline-coverage reads too)
 * and held to RPC_METHODS, which is generated from rpc-schema/openrpc.json.
