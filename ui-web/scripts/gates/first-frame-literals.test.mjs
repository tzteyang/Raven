/* The words the page can put on screen that no `t(key)` looked up.
 *
 * CONTRIBUTING section 4.3 is "words come from t(key)", and the catalogue is
 * the one place a language lives -- a literal in a module is a word one
 * reader's language cannot reach. Three sets of them survive, for three
 * different reasons, and this is what keeps each set down or gone:
 *
 *  - The served first frame. `src/page.html` is what a reader sees before any
 *    script has run: the document's `lang` and the no-JavaScript shell that
 *    explains a page whose bundle did not execute. No catalogue has loaded and
 *    no store could read one, so the shell is written in one language. The
 *    `lang` attribute is a tag rather than a word, so the runs counted for
 *    that file are all the shell's.
 *  - A fallback argument. A confirm sheet's title and button, the settings
 *    heading, the capability filter's four chips and its search field, the chat
 *    heading, the environment chip, the permission chip: each renders a literal
 *    while `lang.get()` has answered nothing yet, which is the very frame
 *    `scripts/__golden__/` and `src/test/__golden__/` record. Turning one into
 *    `t()` moves the DOM those goldens are taken from.
 *  - A mark rather than a word. `lib/prose.ts` carries a CJK character class
 *    and a line prefix it matches, `state/session/runtime.ts` strips a
 *    trailing colon of either width, `state/session/naming.ts` compares a
 *    title against the literal `chrome/ChatTop.tsx` serves, and
 *    `features/cron/humanize.ts` joins an already-translated list with an
 *    ideographic comma -- drawn, but punctuation rather than a word.
 *
 * The unit is a maximal run of CJK characters, not a line: CJK is written
 * without spaces, so an unbroken run is the closest machine-checkable thing to
 * a word, and a line already on the table cannot carry a second word in for
 * free. A character class pays once per gap its dashes cut, which is why
 * `lib/prose.ts` holds the largest number here and not the largest debt.
 *
 * Where a run can sit and still be part of the program, for a `.ts`/`.tsx`
 * module (`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` too, though src/ has none today): a
 * string, a template chunk, JSX text, a regular expression or an identifier,
 * found by parsing the module rather than by reading its lines. So a header
 * that quotes one of these strings is not one, and the budget stays a budget
 * for code. A string or template chunk is read cooked, so `'\u65b0'` counts as
 * the character it is; the run is then reported on the node's own first line,
 * having no source position of its own. A run assembled at runtime --
 * `String.fromCharCode(26032)`, a concatenation of escapes -- is out of reach
 * of any parser and is not counted; nothing in src/ does that today, and
 * review is what would catch it. `.css` and `.html` have no parser here and
 * lose their comments by text instead.
 *
 * `src/rpc/fixtures/` is out of the scan: the offline library is canned demo
 * content (489 runs across ten files today) and a Chinese playbook in the
 * demo shell is the demo working, not a lookup the page skipped. The screen
 * those fixtures reach is `?stub=1`, never a gateway's.
 *
 * What counts as non-English is the repo's own definition, the `CJK_RUN` of
 * `scripts/check_source_language.py` -- Han, kana, hangul, CJK punctuation and
 * full-width forms. Deliberately narrower than "any non-ASCII": an em-dash in
 * an English comment is not a word. That script is the gate on *adding* one
 * (it reads a PR's added lines); this is the gate on the pile already standing.
 *
 * A ratchet, in the house style of state-dom-touch: a file may go down or
 * disappear, never up, and a file absent from the table may carry none at all.
 * Going down means lowering the row in the same change, so a number is what
 * the tree holds rather than what it once held. The way off the table is a
 * catalogue key, never another run here.
