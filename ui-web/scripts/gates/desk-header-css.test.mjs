/* The pane header's two controls have to sit on the same line as each other.
 *
 * They are not the same kind of thing: the fullscreen control holds an inline
 * <svg>, which is laid out on the text baseline with the descender space still
 * under it, and the close control holds the "x" character, which sits wherever
 * the font's metrics put it. Left to those two rules the icon rode 1.5px above
 * the x -- measured in a browser, and visible in the product as two controls
 * that do not line up. Centring the button's content is what makes the pair
 * agree, whatever each one contains.
 *
 * Pinned here because no DOM test can see it: happy-dom does no layout, so the
 * only place this invariant is written down is the stylesheet.
