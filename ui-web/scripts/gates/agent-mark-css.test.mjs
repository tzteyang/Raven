/* Which agent marks the dark theme filters, and with which filter.
 *
 * Three kinds of file sit in `assets/agents/`, and `data-tone` is what carries
 * the distinction from the map in AgentMark.tsx to this stylesheet:
 *
 * - no tone: every shape carries its own fill. Renders the same in both themes
 *   and comes out as a photographic negative if inverted -- Claude's terracotta
 *   turns cyan. Filter nothing.
 * - `mono`: every shape is `currentColor`, which an <img> resolves against the
 *   SVG's own document rather than the page, so the file renders black and is
 *   invisible on a dark surface until the theme inverts the lot.
 * - `hybrid`: some shapes are and some are not, which is qoder alone. A plain
 *   invert lifts the currentColor half correctly AND takes the brand green with
 *   it (#2ADB5C -> #D524A3, magenta); the hue rotation puts the hue back.
 *
 * So neither filter is a theme preference, each is a per-file correction, and
 * applying the wrong one is silent. Pinned here because no DOM test can see it:
 * happy-dom applies no stylesheet, so `filter` is unobservable there. The
 * markup half -- that the tone reaches the element -- is pinned in
 * AgentMark.test.tsx, and the tone-matches-the-file half in
 * tests/test_ui_agent_marks.py; this is the half that says the stylesheet still
 * reads it, and reads it per tone.
 *
 * The provider marks are the same mechanism with the ratio reversed: those
 * files are all currentColor and one is not, so that block inverts by default
 * and exempts the exception. Agents are mostly colour, so this one filters
 * nothing by default. Neither may become a blanket rule.
