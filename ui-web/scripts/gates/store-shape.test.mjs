/* One store shape, one set of verbs, and one place the notify lives.
 *
 * A store on this page is a module singleton holding one value, made by
 * src/state/store.ts's makeStore: `get` reads the snapshot, `set` writes it and
 * notifies synchronously, `subscribe` is what useSyncExternalStore is given, and
 * `_resetForTests` puts the value back. Every one of those used to be spelled
 * per module -- get or getState or saved or snapshot, set or put or commit, and
 * twenty copies of the flushSync notify -- and the twenty-first copy to forget
 * the flushSync would be a DOM write one tick late, which an imperative reader
 * sees as stale and no test catches.
 *
 * Three ratchets, in the house style: each PINNED list is what the tree holds
 * today and may only shrink. A new module has to land on makeStore; an existing
 * one comes off the list by being moved onto it, never by being added here.
 * Every pin carries the reason it is one, because a pin with no reason reads as
 * a rule nobody meant.
