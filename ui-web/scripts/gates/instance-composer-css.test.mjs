/* A sub-agent's composer is the page's own composer, one size down.

 * The two share their markup's class names, so `.dock-in` gives both the glass,
 * the blur, the rim light and the border, and neither can drift from the other
 * on any of it. What `.instance-dock` is allowed to restate is the part that
 * genuinely differs inside a pane: how big the card is and how hard it casts.
 * Anything else appearing there is the two composers starting to diverge again,
 * which no DOM test can see -- the stylesheet is the only place it is written.
