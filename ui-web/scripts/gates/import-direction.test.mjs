/* Which way an import may point, and every edge that points the other way.
 *
 * The page has one shape, read from the entry down:
 *
 *   lib <- components <- chrome <- app
 *   lib <- rpc <- state <- chrome, features, app
 *   lib <- features <- app
 *   features -/-> features   (a sibling is reached through its source.ts or
 *                             types.ts, which is the domain's public surface)
 *   state -/-> features      (at runtime; a type import erases, and a call the
 *                             other way is a registered callback --
 *                             state/page.ts's onShow)
 *
 * Nothing enforced it before this file. `tsc` reports neither direction nor
 * cycles, so every new upward edge was free, and the largest single one --
 * state/page.ts reaching the island bag -- put every store that opens a page in
 * the closure of every other, 87 modules deep, with a module-eval order that
 * threw in one test's graph.
 *
 * A ratchet in the house style (see state-dom-touch.test.mjs): PINNED is every
 * upward edge the tree holds today and CROSS every cross-domain one, and both
 * may only shrink. A new one fails here -- and the fix is to invert the call
 * (a registered callback, or the sibling's source.ts), not to add a line below.
 *
 * Read from the source text, so it sees what a reader sees: relative
 * specifiers resolved the way Vite resolves them, `import type` and
 * `import { type X }` dropped (they erase), tests excluded -- a case is an
 * entry point and may reach anything.
 *
 * The cycles are pinned the same way: every strongly connected component of
 * the runtime graph has to be a subset of one listed in CYCLES, and no more
 * files may be inside one than are today. Two pairs stood beside the two left,
 * and each dissolved the same way an upward edge does: the call that closed it
 * is registered by the module that owns the answer rather than imported back.
