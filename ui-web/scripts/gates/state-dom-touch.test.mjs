/* Which layer is allowed to reach for an element, how often, and what it may
 * write once it has one.
 *
 * A store writing the flag on its own region is how this page works: the region
 * is rendered by src/App.tsx as the value the page was served with, and exactly
 * one store writes it afterwards (see App.tsx's own list). What the arrangement
 * cannot survive is a second writer, and every second writer starts as one more
 * `getElementById` in a module that already had some -- which is why this
 * counts them per file rather than forbidding them.
 *
 * Every match is counted, not every line that holds one: `document.body` beside
 * a `querySelector` in one ternary is two reaches, and a number that claims to
 * say how often has to answer for both. The page's own `$` (src/lib/dom.ts) is
 * `document.querySelector` under a shorter name, so it is a reach like any
 * other -- five modules reach that way and nothing else -- and the only file it
 * is not counted in is the one that defines it, on the EXEMPT list below.
 *
 * A ratchet, and both halves of one: the numbers below are what the tree holds
 * today, a file may only go down or disappear, and a count that has FALLEN
 * fails as well, naming the number to write instead. A new file, or a higher
 * count in a pinned one, fails -- and the fix is to say in that module's header
 * why it reaches for an element and to spend the budget somewhere else, not to
 * raise a number because the sum still looks small. A pin nobody lowers is
 * budget the tree grows back into for free.
 *
 * The three layers with no page to reach for are held at zero instead, with
 * their two exceptions registered by name: src/lib/dom.ts IS the page's `$`,
 * and src/components/Ico.tsx builds detached svg nodes with createElementNS,
 * which is a node nobody can reach by id because it has no document in it yet.
 *
 * src/app is pinned rather than zero, because the page's lifecycle is where the
 * elements nobody renders are handled: the pre-JavaScript splash it takes down,
 * the rail it holds on skeleton rows, and the rail-foot row the update notice
 * fills.
 *
 * WRITES is the other half of the rule, over the same layers: the text, the
 * class and the markup of an element that was rendered elsewhere. A store may
 * write the flag on its own region (`data-open`), and that is a dataset write
 * this does not count; setting `textContent` or `innerHTML` on a node React
 * owns is the case rule (a) does not reach, and the twenty-two the tree still
 * holds are counted per file so they can only fall. A file absent from that
 * table may not write at all. features/ is out of this gate's reach, here as
 * above -- CONTRIBUTING section 4.2 says why.
 *
 * The page frame -- src/chrome/, src/App.tsx and src/main.tsx -- is counted in
 * FRAME instead, and its reaches are not violations of the rule above: that
 * rule is about a second writer on a region a store already owns, and these are
 * the page's own imperative behaviours. App.tsx portals into the body, the two
 * popovers write into a list the page was served with, main.tsx mounts the
 * island roots in the boxes that root committed, and chrome/behaviour/ is two
 * modules that say in their own headers that they are behaviour rather than
 * rendering: a grip drag writing one CSS variable, and scrollbar thumbs parked
 * in a fixed layer over elements other layers drew. Counting them is what keeps
 * a third such module from appearing unnoticed -- the counts may only fall, and
 * a frame file that is not on the list may not reach for an element at all.
 *
 * What the counts read is text, and three limits come with that. Two of the
 * twenty-six matches FRAME holds are a sentence in a module header that names
 * document.body, and two more are React's own `createElement` in main.tsx,
 * which the regex cannot tell from the document's: a budget that counts a
 * little too much is the safe direction for a ratchet. `event.target.closest()`
 * is deliberately not a reach -- it climbs from a node the handler was handed,
 * which is what every delegated listener on this page does, and counting it
 * would put a number on lib/popover.ts for reading the card around an anchor it
 * takes as an argument. And a reach spelled through an alias
 * (`const doc = globalThis.document`, then `doc.body`) is invisible to a text
 * match; no module does that today, and the honest statement is that this gate
 * would not see it.
