/* The roster's fold slot must keep its width on a head that cannot fold.
 *
 * The list is one column of agents, a few of which have conversations under
 * them. When the slot was removed from the flow for the rest (`hidden`, which
 * is `display: none`), the foldable heads carried their icon and their name
 * 12px right of everyone else's and the list read as two vertical lines.
 *
 * Pinned here because no DOM test can see it: happy-dom does no layout, so a
 * rule that occupies space versus one that does not are the same assertion
 * there. The markup half -- that every head has the slot -- is pinned in
 * SubagentsPage.test.tsx; this is the half that says the slot still takes up
 * room when it is empty.
