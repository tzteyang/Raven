/* Every island follows the page's language, because its root component
 * subscribes to the store that holds it.
 *
 * A language pick used to be a hand-written list of island redraws
 * (state/lang/effects.ts), and the list was incomplete by construction: seven
 * domains that call t() were never in it, so a flip left them in the language
 * before it -- for as long as the reader kept the page open. The chrome had the
 * answer all along (seventeen components read `useSyncExternalStore(lang.subscribe,
 * lang.get)`); this holds each island's root to the same line, so a new domain
 * follows a flip by existing rather than by being remembered.
 *
 * A domain with no root of its own is named below with the reason: what it
 * renders is somebody else's tree, or it is mounted per lane and keeps the one
 * imperative repaint the effects list still carries.
