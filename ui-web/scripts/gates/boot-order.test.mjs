/* The page defers its first data-driven paint until every source is installed.
 *
 * One concern per gate: the first-run model redirect and the permission chip
 * used to ride along in here, over a concatenation of eight modules, and are
 * their own gates now (first-run-model-setup.test.mjs, permission-chip.test.mjs)
 * over the modules that actually carry them. What is left is the sequence: the
 * order boot() runs its steps in, the order bootPage() paints in, and the two
 * facts about the claim on the first frame that no rendered tree can show.
 *
 * Driven rather than read where a run can show it. `boot()`'s three steps used
 * to be read off its body with a regex anchored to two-space indentation, which
 * made a reformat a failure and a reordering inside a nested block invisible;
 * the steps are recorded through fakes now, the way the paint below always was.
