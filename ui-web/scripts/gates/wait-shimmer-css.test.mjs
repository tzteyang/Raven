/* A loading bar shimmers, and holds still for a reader who asked for less
 * motion.
 *
 * The bars are the whole of what a wait says: they carry no text, so a bar
 * that does not move is indistinguishable from an empty grey box that is all
 * the page will ever show. happy-dom applies no stylesheet and runs no
 * animation, so every case that asserts a wait is on screen would pass just as
 * well over a dead rectangle -- the movement is a fact about paint, and the
 * sheet is where it can be pinned.
 *
 * Every sheet that draws one, because a class name has one owner and three
 * namespaces draw a bar: the settings sections under the domain's prefix
 * (features/settings/Skeletons.tsx), the two-pane frame under its own
 * (components/TwoPane.tsx) and the schedules' run history under the cron
 * domain's (features/cron/CronPage.tsx). None may quietly lose its
 * reduced-motion rule.
