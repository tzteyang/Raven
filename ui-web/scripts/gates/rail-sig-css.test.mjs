// Every state the session row's tail slot can hold must have a visible mark,
// read straight off the stylesheet. jsdom does no layout and computes no custom
// properties, so the component test can see `data-sig` and the ARIA label and
// nothing about whether the reader is shown anything at all: `ask` shipped with
// geometry and no colour, which renders a transparent 6px dot over a timestamp
// the same selector hides.
//
// The set is DERIVED from the component rather than listed here. Listing it
// would repeat the omission for the next state added -- the whole defect was a
// state reaching the tail slot with nobody having written its mark.
