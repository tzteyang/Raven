// A class name is shared state, so every domain's classes carry that domain's
// prefix -- and what is unprefixed is borrowed from the page's own vocabulary
// on purpose.
//
//   node ui-web/scripts/check-class-namespace.mjs
//
// The knowledge dialog's buttons first shipped under `acts`, a class the
// transcript already owns: `.acts button` makes every button a 27px borderless
// icon square, it outranks `.mini`, and Cancel and Create rendered as two grey
// words touching each other. Nothing caught it -- happy-dom applies no
// stylesheet, so no rendering test can see a collision, and the CSS itself was
// valid.
//
// This used to state that rule page-wide and then check one island against one
// hard-coded prefix, over a 6,000-line global stylesheet. The prefixes are read
// from the domains themselves now (features/<domain>/manifest.ts: the directory
// name, or the `cssPrefix` six of them declare because they named their classes
// consistently before there was a rule), and the three debts the tree carries
// are pinned below and may only shrink:
//
//   LEGACY_SHARED -- a class two or more domains name that is not page
//                    vocabulary. A NEW one fails; an existing one reaching one
//                    more domain fails.
//   LEGACY_LOCAL  -- how many of a domain's own classes are still unprefixed.
//                    One more fails.
//   LEGACY_EXPR   -- how many unprefixed classes a domain names from inside a
//                    `className={...}` expression. One more fails.
//
// So the tree is green as it stands and no debt can grow, which is what makes
// features/<domain>/styles.css usable: a domain's new rules go in its own sheet
// under its own prefix (features/extAgents/styles.css says how), and the rules
// already in styles/page.css come across a domain at a time, each move lowering
// a number here.
//
// Reach: every class a domain's non-test .tsx and .ts files name. A class is
// written in four ways and all four are read --
//
//   className="a b"   the attribute, in either quote
//   class="a b"       the same attribute inside a string of markup, which is
//                     what `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is handed
//   classList.add()   and its three siblings, the class set on an element by
//                     hand rather than declared in the markup
//   className={...}   the expression: every single-quoted, double-quoted and
//                     template-literal static chunk, split on whitespace, and
//                     the same again inside each `${...}` hole
//
// -- because a rule about names is worth only as much as the narrowest way of
// writing one. A token glued to an interpolation is a stem rather than a class
// (`kbf-${family}` names `.kbf-md`, never `.kbf-`), so it is not read as one.
//
// What is NOT read, and cannot be by reading text: a class that reaches the
// attribute as an identifier (`className={cls}`, `{...{ className }}`), and a
// class handed to a component under some other prop name (`cls="x"`). Neither
// end of those is a literal this check can hold to a prefix, and a count of the
// sites would not say which class went through them, so they are a limit rather
// than a list. `src/lib/prose.ts` is the largest of them: it builds markup for
// the whole shell and belongs to no namespace (CONTRIBUTING section 11).
//
// What an expression cannot tell apart is a class from a comparison operand:
// `state === 'bad' ? 'v err' : 'v'` names .v and .err and reads 'bad' as a class
// too. So the expression literals are counted in LEGACY_EXPR rather than mixed
// into the two lists above -- an operand there costs a row on one domain's count
// instead of a wrong verdict about a shared class -- and the prefix rule's
// inverse (a prefixed class the stylesheets define) holds over them as it does
// over the attribute literals.
//
// Two namespaces beyond features/, read the same way and pinned the same way:
//
//   chrome      -- src/chrome/** plus src/App.tsx and src/main.tsx, the page's
//                  own frame. A class it introduces is named `chrome-<rest>`,
//                  or exactly `chrome`.
//   components  -- src/components/**, the components more than one region
//                  renders. There the namespace is the file, because that is
//                  what owns the markup: Skeleton.tsx names `skeleton-<rest>`,
//                  SetupSheet.tsx names `setup-sheet-<rest>`, and a component's
//                  own root class may be the bare name (`agent-mark`). One file
//                  at a time, so each is held to its own name: ModelTags.tsx
//                  owning `.model-tags` does not let SetupSheet.tsx write it,
//                  and the row that fails names the borrower and the owner. A
//                  class belongs to the LONGEST of those names it carries, so
//                  an `Agent.tsx` cannot answer for `.agent-mark-row`.
//
// Every .tsx under src/ belongs to one of the three, which is checked rather
// than assumed: a component filed outside them all is markup nothing here
// reads, and so is a class nothing holds to a prefix.
//
// A name in SHARED passes in both, as it does in a domain, and so does a name
// already on LEGACY_SHARED: that row is the debt of a class two domains name,
// and counting the frame's use of it again would say the debt grew when nothing
// moved. LEGACY_SHARED itself stays scoped to features for the same reason --
// the frame renders the page every domain sits in, so most of the page-wide
// names it writes would read as one more domain and every row would move
// without a class changing. What these two still owe is pinned per namespace:
//
//   LEGACY_CHROME      -- how many names a namespace writes without carrying
//                         its prefix, a row per (class, prefix) pair: `chrome`
//                         has one prefix, so that is per class, and
//                         `components` has one per file, so a class two
//                         components write is a row on each of them.
//   LEGACY_CHROME_EXPR -- the same count inside a `className={...}` expression.
//   LEGACY_BORROWED    -- which LEGACY_SHARED rows the namespace helps itself
//                         to, by name, since those pass the two counts above.
//   UNSTYLED           -- a class the markup writes that page.css, the only
//                         sheet either namespace has, does not define.
//
// Down or gone, all four. A name the frame and one domain both write is a row
// on both sides, and either can retire its own: this counts what a namespace
// owes, not how many names the page has.
