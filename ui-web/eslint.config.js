/* What a module may import, in what order, and what it may leave behind.
 *
 * `make lint-ui` was gen:check plus type-check, and neither sees an import.
 * Import style had already diverged four ways in one tree -- types first, types
 * last, types interleaved, unsorted -- and an unused import or local cost
 * nothing to leave in, because tsconfig had neither noUnusedLocals nor a linter
 * behind it.
 *
 * The same engine and the same base as ui-tui: ../eslint.base.mjs is a factory
 * because the repo root has no node_modules, so each package imports its own
 * plugins and passes them in. What is added here is the React half -- the hooks
 * rules, which are what a component in this tree can get wrong -- and the four
 * places the base's rules do not fit this tree: where a type import goes, the
 * one-line guard `curly` would brace, a test naming the type of a module it
 * loads dynamically, and the gates under scripts/, which are node scripts
 * rather than part of the page.
