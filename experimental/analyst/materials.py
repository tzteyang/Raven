"""Compose what the analyst reads: signals, conversations, record summaries and the loop's history.

The history is the Analyst's projection of it (`experimental.iteration.history`): the Curator's diagnoses name
mechanisms, and the Analyst attributes behavior, not mechanism, so they are left out; a revision's predicted effects
stay in the record, so the Analyst judges what happened rather than what was promised."""
