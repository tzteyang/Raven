"""Export one cultivation run's records as a self-contained, reviewable cultivation record.

A run directory holds what `experimental.iteration.run` and the travel-agency simulation wrote: the iteration record
with its analysis and curation records, the kept deliverables, `settings.json` and, once the suite finished the run,
`suite-summary.json`, beside the employee's area `employee/` (each Harness generation's `observations.jsonl` and the
agent home) and each replica's under `replicas/`. `build_record`
reads them without any model call and returns one JSON-serialisable dict (schema 1). `export_record` writes that dict
(`record.json`), its ledger (`ledger.json`), a Markdown transcript, copies of the deliverables and the page images
that already exist beside them, the scenario inputs, and `manifest.json` with every file's SHA-256, size and time.
Every string the record carries passes `redact`; no `config.json`, credential folder or trace log is ever copied.

Linking rules. Every link is one the loop or the run's evaluation recorded, and says which; the record matches no
text:

- A requirement links `grounds` to the criteria its grounds name as `check:<criterion id>`; its `case:<id>` grounds
  are its `cases`. A requirement without a check ground links `reading` to the rules the run's `attribution.json`
  reads it as restating (`experimental.simulation.attribution.read_requirements`, a model reading kept beside the
  records), and `none` when there is no such reading. Its id, `repeats`, `situation` and grounds
  are the round's feedback; whether it `held` is the run's typed history (`experimental.iteration.history`), where
  the loop's one rule decided it (`experimental.iteration.ledger`).
- A curation's change links `addresses` to criteria through the inputs it addresses, as the change of the same scope
  and target in the typed history entry of the round it followed records them: an addressed requirement id brings
  that requirement's check grounds, while a material, a playbook node or the task brings none, so onboarding attaches
  to no criterion. Only an installed curation a round's record names, the root's or a child harness's installed with
  it, has that entry; any other curation keeps empty `addresses` and attaches to none.
- A material was given at onboarding when the opening signals hand it over by name (a `Handover`) or the disclosure
  plan gives it then, and otherwise in the first round whose signals hand it over or after which the next round's
  analysis reads it as a skill (the way a material copied straight into the skill pool shows); one found only in the
  employee's home was handed over in an unknown round.
- A target's facet is the role the target catalogue gives it (so `planning.skills` is capability); `prompt.*` counts
  as memory and anything else as other.
- Mechanism evidence is the planning, participant, component, strategy (action, capability, memory), inference,
  hosting and loop-control rows of each drill turn, grouped by kind, target and decision, plus tool calls refused in
  that turn, each decision counted once (see `experimental.analyst.activity`), with the distinct reasons given and
  how often. Review verdicts `resample` and `end`, refused tools and refused planning steps are interventions.
- Mechanism rows carry the harness scope they ran in: `root`, or the child harness whose process records a
  `child.execution` row carries.
- In the criterion ledger (`ledger`), a criterion's evidence for a round counts the mechanism rows of the scope and
  target that an installed curation sedimented for it before that round, from the drills its verdicts name (every
  drill when none is named).
- A criterion is `never_failed` when judged and never failed, `not_exercised` when never judged pass or fail,
  `still_failing` when its last judged round failed or was mixed, and otherwise `held_since_round_N`, where round N
  starts its final run of passing rounds.

Artifact diffs compare a curation's candidate with the merged artifact the last installed curation of the same scope
left; the hired baseline counts as empty, and a curation that was not installed does not advance it. A curation that
failed shows the last candidate it submitted for a check. Curation records that no round names are joined by their
feedback and say so. Turns in the observations that no recorded round holds (a trial cut off mid-round) form a last
round marked `partial`. Paths are relative to the run directory; `export_record` rewrites them into `assets/`.

`run.reproduce` is the command line the run stored in its settings, with the configuration, homes and folders left to
the reader; a run from before the command line was stored gets one rebuilt from its settings (see `_command`).

Keys beyond the agreed schema (`run.steps`, `run.warnings`, `run.suite`, `run.reproduce`, `unlinked_deliverables`,
`node_requirements`, `value` (the verdict of `experimental.simulation.value`), `requirements_ledger` (the loop's own
ledger as `experimental.iteration.records.load` joins it: `rows`, `summary` and `holdout`, or null when the record
could not be joined), each requirement's `id`, `situation`, `repeats`, `grounds`, `cases` and `held`, each change's
`treatment`, `addresses`, `attached` and `paths`, each mechanism row's `scope`, `count` and `intervention`, and the
like) are additive. Cost comes from `suite-summary.json` when the suite wrote one, else from the audit spans under
`<state_root>/<run name>/traces/logs` or the copy in the run's own `traces/`, else it is null.

The transcript's labels are English; a scenario may override any of them in a `record.md` beside its
`scenario.json`, one `- key: label` line per label.
