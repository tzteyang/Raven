"""Decide from a cultivation record whether a run shows the case this simulation looks for.

The case: over several rounds of the owner's feedback, the Curator's revisions brought the employee to meet the
owner's core requirements. Two things count as value: the Curator shaping the Harness from what the owner handed over
(a mechanism built at onboarding that then enforced a rule, a held case below), and the Curator improving it from the
owner's supplements and feedback (a cultivated rule, and a hard case). A rule is **cultivated** when it failed in a
round while the employee already had the material covering it (a round where the owner said the miss only waited on
material does not count), a curation installed after that round answered it on any surface (prompt, skill, playbook,
planning, action, in the root or a child harness), and it held in every judged round after. A run **qualifies** when
it completed at least `MIN_ROUNDS` rounds, at least `CULTIVATED` rules were cultivated, planning or action enforced at
least one rule (a hard case or a held case, below: a prompt or skill revision alone never makes the case), its last
round met the core (no red-line rule missed, at most `TOLERATED` standard rules missed), every drill of the last round
still delivered a deck, and its isolation scan found no breach (`experimental.automation.isolation`). It is **partial** when it shows cultivated, hard or held rules but misses
another condition; a run whose employee left its bounds is **invalid**, whatever else it shows.

A curation answers, or sediments, a rule through a change that addresses a requirement grounded on the rule, by the
ids the loop recorded (the record's links, see `experimental.simulation.record`).

A hard case is read the same deterministic way:

- A rule is a **case** when an installed curation after round s sedimented it as planning or action (the role the
  target catalogue gives the target), it failed or was mixed in some round up to s while the employee already had the
  material covering it (a round where the owner said the miss only waited on material does not count), every judged
  round after s passed, and in those later rounds, in the drills that judged the rule, that very target in that very
  harness (the root or the child whose process ran it) intervened for this rule: sent work back, ended it, or refused
  a planning step, or for a tool gate or hook refused a tool, with a reason that enforces this rule. Rows of other
  targets, rows that only ran, and interventions for other reasons (another rule, or a wrong block) do not count; a
  rule sedimented through several targets is still one case.
- Which rule an intervention enforces is read from the record's `attribution`, where a model read each reason
  against the rules (see `experimental.simulation.attribution`); a record without one credits no intervention to any
  rule.
- A rule is a **held case** when planning or action was installed for it at onboarding, it passed every judged round,
  and that target intervened for it. There is no "before" to compare with, so it is weaker evidence.
