"""Drill cards with drawn values: each time a card is played, its trip facts are drawn afresh within the card's ranges.

A card is a persona file whose frontmatter declares `values`. The trip keys carry meaning the agency's checks rely on:
`address` (how the traveller is addressed), `origin`, `destination`, `start` (a `MM-DD` date), `nights`, `adults`
(seniors included), `children` and `seniors` (one age per person), `budget` (the party total) and `phone` (a list of
prefixes; the remaining eight digits are drawn). Any other key is a free value for the text. A value is fixed, a list
to choose from, or a `{from, to, step}` range (dates as `MM-DD`); `children` and `seniors` list one such value per
person. Strings may name earlier values in braces, such as `address: Mr {surname}`.

The text names values in braces; a date `start` also gives `start_month` and `start_day`, the trip gives `end`,
`end_month` and `end_day`, and the i-th child or senior is `child_i` or `senior_i`. A card without frontmatter plays
as written and has no trip facts.
