"""Report-template shape: a per-turn reminder, and a deterministic bar on it.

``final_shape.report_structure`` asks the model for a three-section report
(``## Answer`` / ``## Findings`` / ``## Limitations``) and the same label added the rule
that the template outranks a format the question itself asks for. Both live in
the system prompt, and a system prompt is the weakest place to put an
instruction that a conversation can argue with:

* **Recency loses to it.** Measured on this repo's own demo sessions (30 turns
  carrying the template, dr@3.4): 8/14 research turns well-formed, but only
  2/9 of the turns the conversation gate ruled non-research. Those are the
  reformat/expand follow-ups, and the sessions where they failed had two or
  three earlier replies that were outlines - the model's own history is a
  stronger few-shot than one clause fifteen thousand tokens up the context.
* **Nothing checks it.** The verify gate reviews claims against evidence, not
  layout, and it is wrapped in ``GatedHook`` so it does not run on the
  non-research turns at all. The template was asked for and then never read
  back by anything.

So this module adds the two cheapest things that fix those two facts, and
nothing more.

**The reminder** (``render_reminder``) rides the current user message, the same
seam and the same lifetime as the research memo: injected at assembly, stripped
before persist, so it never accumulates across turns and never becomes history.
It is ~60 tokens of the same instruction, sitting where recency helps instead of
hurting.

**The bar** (:class:`ReportShapeGate`) is a deterministic markdown check - no
model call, no evidence, no latency - so unlike the verify gate it can afford to
run on *every* turn, which is exactly where the template was losing. A draft
missing a section bounces back once with an instruction to rewrite it into the
template while keeping every finding, source and caveat.

What it deliberately does **not** do, and why:

* **It never rewrites the draft itself.** Restructuring a finished answer is the
  failure class this repo has measured twice - an upstream framework's
  extraction stage carried gold on 71/120 questions into 58/120 boxed fields,
  dropping 10.83pp while inventing nothing, and dr@1.6's salvage seam failed
  identically. The rewrite is asked of the model, in the generation where it can
  still consult its own evidence; this module only decides whether to ask.
* **It bounces only for a MISSING section.** A decorated heading
  (``## 1. Answer``, ``## **Answer**``, ``## Findings (as a slide outline)`` - the
  last is a real shape from these sessions), a translated heading (a Chinese
  ``## Answer``), a heading at the wrong level, or three sections in the wrong
  order are all recorded and all shipped. Each bounce
  costs a full generation, and a reader loses nothing to a numbered or bolded
  heading; only an absent section is missing content the template promised.
  The ruler is deliberately lax in one direction and not the other: judging a
  present section absent spends a generation on punctuation, judging an absent
  one present ships one malformed reply. The second is the cheaper mistake, so
  the matcher takes it.
* **A bounce leaves no history.** The rejected draft and the rewrite request are
  injected as ``_recovery_synthetic`` scaffolding: the re-sample reads them, the
  session never stores them. Persisting them would contradict the paragraph
  above - the outline the bar just rejected would sit in the next turn's context
  as an example of what to write. Its length is kept (``draft_chars``): against
  the delivered ``final_shape.visible_chars`` that is the rewrite's shrink, and
  it is the only way to ask whether a bounce cost evidence, since the draft
  itself is gone from every record.
* **It never bounces an empty draft.** An answerless terminal belongs to
  ``ForcedFinalizeGate``, which runs ahead of this one. "May improve a record,
  never blank one" is the same rule ``final_shape`` states, one layer up.
* **It bounces at most once per turn**, and fails open on anything unexpected.
