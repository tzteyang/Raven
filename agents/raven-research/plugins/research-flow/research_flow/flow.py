"""Chain assembly: the fork's ``build_dr_flow`` observers on the trunk's hook seams.

``build_chain`` is a faithful port of the fork's observer assembly
(``raven/agent/flow/dr.py``): same conditions, same constructor kwargs, same
order, ``GatedHook`` / ``ClarifyExemptHook`` wrapping preserved. What the fork's
loop did around the observers - the turn-mode decision, the memo / brief /
reminder injections, the memo update, the process appendix, the pending-clarify
persistence - is one extra hook here, :class:`TurnFrame`, built into the same
chain.

:class:`ResearchFlowHook` is the single contributed hook. The fork ran one loop
per session, so a flow assembly was per-session by construction; the trunk runs
one runtime for every session, so this hook keys a lazily built chain by
``(session_key, mode)``, resolving the knobs as the base :class:`FlowConfig`
deep-merged with the session mode's ``drFlow`` overlay, and dispatches each
phase to a :class:`~raven.agent.hook.composite.CompositeHook` over the chain so
short-circuit / rollback / note chaining semantics are the loop's own.
