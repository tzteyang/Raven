"""``glob``: the fork's spelling of trunk's pathname-pattern tool.

Same engine, one name and one description: the fork measured that models
trained on the common convention reach for ``glob`` and read its output as a
listing, not as a command to run. The product config withholds trunk's
``find`` so the face carries one spelling.

Brace alternation (``*.{ts,tsx}``) is part of that convention and trunk's
engine takes one pattern, so it is expanded here and the listings are merged.
The engine returns paths together with status text. The merge preserves
errors, carries any child truncation into the final notice, deduplicates the
paths and sorts them by recency before applying the caller's total limit.
