# What is Raven

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f400d693-d8cf-46eb-b846-6948f66f6fed"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f400d693-d8cf-46eb-b846-6948f66f6fed" alt="Raven one surface, all agents workflow" width="100%"></a>
</p>

<p align="center"><em>One Surface, All Agents: Raven generates DAGs and orchestrates multiple specialized agents for complex tasks.</em></p>

Raven is **the harness of harnesses, built for recursive self-improvement (RSI).** As a **Host Agent**, it brings built-in and third-party agents together to carry out complex tasks. Its modular architecture supports iterative improvement of Raven's own harness: proposing changes to how agents plan and act, evaluating those changes, and adopting improvements that pass validation. Powered by [EverOS](https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverOS), Raven carries memory and context across sessions to support this process.

**Built-in Agents: Raven-Research**, **Raven-Code**, **Raven-Design**, and **Raven-Oncall** support research, coding, visual design, and unattended workflow automation.

> Raven is pre-alpha. Interfaces and configuration may change quickly.

## ❯❯ Showcase

These are three complete projects delivered by Raven. In each case, Raven drove a team of specialized agents from the initial brief or objective through execution to a complete set of final deliverables.

### ❯ THRESHOLD: a complete game development project

**The brief came from a person; Raven completed the entire project.** Working autonomously for about 4 days, Raven completed 42 rounds of planning, development, and verification to build a playable first-person shooter in Godot 4, centered on an arena boss fight. The full deliverable includes the game, its poster, presentation, and website, all produced by Raven.

### ❯ Raven RSI: recursive self-improvement in practice

**AI that improves AI, with the entire project completed by Raven.** Given a task and evaluation criteria it cannot modify, Raven RSI independently plans each round, writes code, runs experiments, and evaluates the results. In nanochat pre-training experiments, it completed 172 training runs across 7 rounds without a single crash, reducing `val_bpb` by 5.8% within the same 20-minute, single-GPU budget. The same process reduced overshoot in a dam-break simulation by three orders of magnitude and completed an FEA limit-load search in 8 rounds of bisection. The complete deliverable includes the experimental results, visualizations, poster, presentation, and project website, all produced by Raven.

**[More showcases](docs/showcase.md)**

## ❯❯ Built-in Agents

Raven's modular architecture is designed for harness self-evolution and subagent creation. Its four built-in agents deliver **state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective domains**, combining reusable harness components with domain-specific tools, skills, and agent loops. Raven can delegate a focused task to a single agent or orchestrate multiple agents within a shared workflow. The harness they share is refined by the **Raven Evolver**, a separate tool that consumes Raven as a library and evaluates candidate harness changes against benchmarks; it develops the agents rather than running inside them.

> All four agents are built in and ready for orchestration out of the box.

### ❯ Raven-Research

**Raven-Research** enables **autonomous deep research** for complex questions, literature reviews, and technical analysis. It delivers clear, structured reports with traceable sources, helping users understand unfamiliar domains, compare alternatives, and make informed decisions.

<p align="center"><em>Raven-Oncall significantly outperforms Claude Code on both success rate and cost for AI4S tasks</em></p>

## ❯❯ Runtime Self-Evolution

**Raven is built for this from the ground up.** Its agent loop is split into four decoupled strategy modules — **Memory** for what a turn gets to see, **Planning** for how it approaches the work, **Capability** for which tools an iteration exposes, **Action** for what to do next and for judging it before it runs. A **Curator** keeps rewriting those four seats: a setting, or a small piece of judgement code written for that agent. What it changes belongs to that agent alone, and once installed the agent runs on it.

**A Curator changes more than the prompt** — the tools and outside services it reaches for, the skills and procedures it follows, and its own judgement at each point can all be replaced. It keeps going round after round — you put it to work, you say what was wrong, it reworks — until you are satisfied, until it has nothing left worth changing, or until the round budget runs out. Two things hold the quality: nothing is installed before it is verified, and a failed check sends it back; and a round's signals normally reach it with the reference answer stripped out, which limits how directly the answer is exposed. The Curator is experimental: it ships with the repository rather than the installed package.

**A Persona is the first thing it builds.** Describe the assistant you want and the Curator assembles one: a lead role that talks to you, and specialists drawn from the agents you already have. What you asked for lands in that assistant's **harness** — its division of work, the tools it may reach for, and the checks it must pass before it acts.

> Describe what you need once. Raven assembles the assistant, keeps improving it while you work, and afterwards a sentence is enough to put it to work again.

## ❯❯ Connect Third-Party Agents

Raven can connect to and orchestrate agents via ACP, CLI, or OpenAI-compatible APIs, with presets for 13 **third-party agents** to simplify setup, task delegation, and coordination across shared workflows. Try these agents in Raven through a unified interface!

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3370c883-00ac-4471-97ef-f4312df77202" width="80%" alt="Third-party agents: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, MiroThinker, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, CodeBuddy, Qoder, Grok Build, Kimi Code, and Pi">
</p>

## ❯❯ Quick Start

### 🤖 Install with Your Agent

Let your own agent install Raven for you. Copy this prompt into any agent that
can read a web page and run shell commands, such as Claude Code or Codex:

```text
Read https://evermind-ai.github.io/Raven/quick-start/ and follow it to install Raven, or to update it if it is already installed.
```

### 📦 Install

Linux, macOS, or WSL2:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raven.evermind.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Native Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raven.evermind.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows PowerShell 5.1 may reject the redirect. Use the direct installer URL instead:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EverMind-AI/Raven/refs/heads/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or run it in a container, with nothing on the host but Git and Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EverMind-AI/Raven.git
cd Raven
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Then open `http://localhost:18793` in your browser. Prerequisites are
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See
[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md) for what comes up, how the page signs
itself in, and how to run it behind a remotely exposed port.

Or install from a source checkout, to develop against the code or to run what
has not been released yet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EverMind-AI/Raven.git
cd Raven
./install.sh
```

Run as a file, `install.sh` installs that checkout in editable mode: raven and
its bundled plugins link back to your tree, and the TUI bundle and the served
page are built from it. A piped run installs the published wheel even from
inside a clone, so that a one-line install never picks up whatever a working
tree happens to contain. Set `RAVEN_LOCAL_SRC=<dir>` to force the editable
install through a pipe.

The agent products ship with raven itself: a wheel carries the `agents/`
product tree and copies it out to your raven home on first use, and a source
checkout reads the tree in place. Setup asks, for each product, whether it
runs on the model it is tuned for, which needs a key of its own, or on this
raven's LLM. Nothing is registered: a folder is on the roster because it is
there. See [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md).
