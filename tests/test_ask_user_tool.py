"""Tests for the ask_user tool's display contract (raven/agent/tools/ask_user.py).

``ask_user`` is the first tool to return :class:`ToolResult`, so this pins the
split it introduces: ``model_text`` keeps the natural-language phrasing the
model reads, ``display_text`` carries the question/answer pairing the transcript
renders, and ``display_call`` labels the row with the question rather than the
raw arguments blob.
