"""The model selector, over the protocol's stable configuration surface.

What is stable is the point of this file. ``session/set_model`` does not exist in
the schema and neither does ``models.availableModels`` -- both appear in older
material -- so the channel is a generic option list with one entry carrying
``category: "model"``. An agent that waited for either of the other two would
never be asked to switch a model.

Two of raven's own facts are asserted here as *visible* rather than merely true:
the switch is scoped to the calling session, and a running turn keeps the binding
it entered with rather than refusing the change. Both are stated in the option's
``description``, which the schema declares as text for the client to display --
so a person reads the caveat where they make the choice, not in a document they
will not open. Both read the other way round until v0.1.13 moved the model onto a
per-session binding, and the description said so for a while after it stopped
being true.
