"""External agent registration over ACP: schema, snapshot, roster, dispatch.

Everything here runs against ``tests/acp_stub_server.py`` as a real child process,
so the launch path, the read loop and teardown are exercised rather than mocked.
The three regression classes at the bottom are the ones worth naming: each is a
place where an acp entry walks into code written for the cli transport and would
fail *silently* -- reporting a working agent as stateless, sharing one test verdict
between two agents, or showing a green light for an agent that cannot run a task.
