"""Persisted session messages carry a wall-clock timestamp.

The real agent loop persists turns through ``AgentLoop._save_turn`` which
appends raw dicts via the ``Session.record`` choke point. These tests drive
the real loop path (stubbed LLM) and assert the JSONL lines on disk carry a
``timestamp`` and no longer carry the dropped per-message ``received_at`` /
``turn_id`` — pinning the simplified stamping contract at the level that
reproduces a real TUI/CLI turn.
