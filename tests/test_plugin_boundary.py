"""Dependency direction between the host and the bundled everos plugin.

The host may know the plugin only through the plugin contract
(``raven.contracts.memory`` and ``raven.plugins``); it must not import the
``raven_everos`` package. The plugin may use the host's public helpers --
``raven.config.update`` included, since the ``plugins.config`` slice it writes
there is its own data -- but must not reach into host modules that exist for
the plugin's sake. The list below holds the violations still standing; a task
that removes one deletes its entry here, and the final task asserts it is
empty.
