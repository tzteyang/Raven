"""Characterization baseline for the storage-form to wire-form conversion.

A stored model id is not what goes on the wire. That rule used to live in seven
places -- two branches of ``LiteLLMProvider._resolve_model``, Codex's own prefix
strip, Azure's URL builder, and three copies outside the providers package. It
now lives only in ``providers.wire``; this file is the baseline that made the
collapse safe, by pinning the wire output across it.

Regenerated deliberately since, for fixes the storage contract required rather
than for drift. Eleven of the 149 entries moved when this landed, in three groups -- stated in full because "the wire output does
not move" is this file's whole claim, and a regeneration whose reasons cover only
part of the delta is that claim quietly weakened:

* **Azure (3)** -- every stored id now names its provider, and that name has to
  come off before the id becomes a URL path segment;
* **local deployments (4)** -- the same change made "hosted-vllm/x" and
  "ollama/x" real stored ids, and the gateway branch double-prefixed them;
* **providers reached through another vendor's driver (4)** -- `custom/x` and
  `siliconflow/x` used to go out as "openai/custom/x", carrying a segment the
  upstream does not serve. Canonicalizing the gateway branch fixed this as a side
  effect, which is why it was not in the first two reasons: it was found by
  diffing against `main`, not by predicting it.

Regenerated once more when Poe stopped shipping a default model. One entry
left the file, ``poe/anthropic/claude-opus-4.8``, and nothing else in any
section moved: the corpus is built from each spec's own fields, so withdrawing
a default withdraws the id it contributed. No wire form changed, which is the
claim this file actually makes.

So these tests are a snapshot, not a specification. They assert that today's
answer for every provider and every shape of model id is byte-for-byte what it
was before the refactor -- including the answers that are arguably wrong. A
defect found here gets reported, not fixed: a fix and a refactor in the same
step leave nothing to bisect against, which is how the previous attempt at this
came to be rolled back.

The corpus is synthetic and derived from each spec's own fields rather than from
LiteLLM's catalogue, so a dependency bump cannot churn the baseline.

Regenerate deliberately, never to make a red test green::
