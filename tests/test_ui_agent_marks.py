"""Every third-party sub-agent preset has a brand mark, and every tone on it is true.

The roster draws a brand mark per agent, chosen by preset key. The preset list
lives in Python and the mark table lives in
``ui-web/src/components/AgentMark.tsx``, so nothing in either language can notice
when they disagree: adding a preset leaves its row wearing the generic glyph,
and renaming a file leaves a row addressing a 404. Both are invisible in
review and neither breaks a build.

This is also the only gate over that table that runs on a merge request.
GitLab's ``tests`` job runs the Python unit suite and nothing else -- the
stylesheet and DOM guards beside this one are vitest and node, which that
image does not have (see ``tests/test_ui_css_token_gate.py``).

The ``tone`` is derived from the file rather than trusted. It says how the SVG
answers the theme, and the dark theme filters each tone differently, so a wrong
one renders as a black mark on a black surface or as a recoloured brand:

- absent: every shape carries its own fill. Theme-independent, filtered not at
  all.
- ``mono``: every shape draws in ``currentColor``, which an ``<img>`` resolves
  against the SVG's own document and so renders black. Inverted wholesale.
- ``hybrid``: some shapes do and some do not. Inverted with the hue rotated
  back, or the brand colour inverts along with the adaptive tone.
