"""The owner of "convert with LibreOffice and leave nothing running", for two callers.

The viewer renders a deck to show it and the ppt engine renders one to measure
it. Both used to spawn LibreOffice themselves, with the same eleven-token argv,
and the two copies had diverged within a day: one knew how to stop a hung
conversion on Windows and the other did not. These tests pin the parts that are
shared -- the argv, the profile of its own, and a teardown that reaches the
process doing the work on either platform -- because that is what a second copy
would drift away from next.

The design engine keeps a third converter of its own, older than either and
wrapped in its own error codes; it is named in the seam test rather than quietly
covered by it, because a test that claims more than it checks is how a copy comes
back.
