"""``build_rpc_stack`` over a host-owned agent loop (the gateway hosting the page).

The default path builds its own engine and owns its whole lifecycle. The
mounted path is handed the gateway's loop and must leave everything
process-scoped -- the subagent submit, cron, the memory backend -- to the
host, or one engine ends up double-wired by two spines. What it must still
take are the page-facing hooks: while the page is mounted, it is the surface
that renders a question or a progress stream.
