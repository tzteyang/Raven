"""The tool array a turn sends is frozen at the turn's entry.

The array is the first segment of the prompt-cache prefix, so a tool that
registers while a turn runs -- an MCP handshake finishing in the background is
the ordinary case since ``prewarm_mcp`` -- would rebuild the whole cached
prompt between two model calls of the same turn. ``turn_scope`` masks such
arrivals until the next turn; the arrival loses nothing by waiting, because
``_mcp_tool_notices`` already tells the model the server is still connecting.

Only arrivals are masked. The operator's off switch stays live per assembly
(that reversibility is the point of the withheld axis), a tool unregistered
mid-turn has no schema to serve anyway, and session-overlay tools enter with
the turn that carries them. A registry that never enters the scope -- a
sub-agent's, the curator's -- advertises everything, exactly as before.

One arrival is let in on purpose: tools the turn's own call produced
(``admit_to_this_turn``), so a plugin the agent just connected is usable
without the user having to send another message.
