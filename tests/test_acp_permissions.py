"""Permission prompts over ACP: the request, the four failures, and the tally.

The rule the whole file turns on is that **nothing from the client escapes**.
Measured from the other direction on codex-acp: any error in reply to this
request cancels the entire turn, so the mirror rule for an agent is that a
client's misbehaviour must resolve to a refusal locally rather than propagate.
Four ways a client gets this wrong, each with its own test, each of them denying.

The other rule is that only this request's own option ids are believed. A client
that answers "the first option" without reading the kinds, or that replays an id
from an earlier prompt, or that synthesises the ``allow_always`` its own UI
offers, is refused rather than trusted -- and the stub client's habit of listing
options in reverse is exactly why that matters.
