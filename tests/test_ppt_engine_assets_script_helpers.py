"""The modules a build script imports, exercised as the script would.

These are generated source, so the only test worth writing runs them: the files
are written into a directory, imported, and used to draw. A test that only
compared strings would pass for a module with a NameError in it, and the author
would find that out in a failed build with the error attributed to its own
program.

Writing the files is deliberately done here rather than by the assets service --
the service returns filename and text, the script backend owns the directory --
so this test is also the check on that contract: everything needed to make a
working build directory has to come out of `script_helper_files()`.

    The author asked `table_size` for a height without giving it the box, took that
    height for the lane, and drew the table with `weights`. Weights are proportions of
    the box a table is given, and the unboxed answer set them aside and measured the
    content-sized table instead -- so the 1.83in it answered was a different table
    from the 2.07in one drawn, whose last rows landed 0.24in inside the note panel
    below. The design's own words for that are that it is impossible, not unlikely
    (`table_size` and `table` share `_table_geometry`), so the fix is in the sharing:
    with no box to fill, the proportions are apportioned over the width the content
    asks for, which is the width the unboxed answer is for.

    Nothing here refuses anything. A table too tall for its box is drawn and hands
    back the box it really filled: this height is a pre-render estimate, and raising
    on it inside the build script would cost the author the page image and every
    finding on the deck with it. Nothing downstream catches this one either -- the
    0.09in the delivered page painted over its note panel is far under the share
    `covered_shape` reads, and `box_overflow` files a table's own words as nobody's
    overflow -- so the arithmetic is where the two have to agree.
