"""The ppt-engine template payload: what git tracks, and the refresh machinery.

The 10 bundled deck templates (about 47 MiB, 7 over the repo's 1 MiB cap) are
tracked, by maintainer approval, because an install that cannot build a deck is
not an install: the registry they used to be fetched from is private, so a fresh
clone got an empty catalogue and the ppt-engine wheel shipped zero templates.
``plugins-dist/ppt-engine/templates.manifest.json`` still pins every file by
sha256. What this family pins: git holds all ten and their bytes satisfy the
pins, the large-file gate allows exactly the pinned names, a pull verifies as it
lands and removes what fails, and the un-named hosting endpoint (verdict C4) is
refused with the owner card rather than guessed at.
