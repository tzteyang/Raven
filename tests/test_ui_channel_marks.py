"""Every channel adapter has an app mark, and every mark file is one the web UI can draw.

The channels section of the settings dialog draws each entrance's app icon,
chosen by channel id. The adapters live in Python (one package each under
``raven/channels/adapters/``) and the mark table lives in
``ui-web/src/components/ChannelMark.tsx``, so nothing in either language notices
when they disagree: a new adapter's row wears the letter tile, and a renamed
file leaves a row asking for a 404 -- which the component also answers with the
letter tile, so neither is visible in review.

The files themselves come from ``scripts/refresh_channel_marks.py``, which
records where each one is published. The rasters are held to the size it
writes: a store's 512px artwork dropped in by hand renders the same at 38px and
costs the bundle ten times the bytes, and the size is what says the script made
the file rather than a download.
