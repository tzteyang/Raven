"""dr@3.4 report-shape reminder and bar.

Two halves, and the second one is why this file is not just unit tests of
``ReportShape``. The reminder is injected in one ``AgentLoop`` method and
stripped in another; if the strip ever misses, it is persisted into history and
every later turn carries a stale copy of an instruction that was meant to be
about the current one - and nothing about that failure is visible in the reply.
Same shape of risk as the research memo, tested the same way: against
``AgentLoop``'s own bound methods rather than a copy of them, because a copy of
the injector agrees with a copy of the stripper no matter what either does.

[port] The injector moved: the plugin's ``TurnFrame.before_user_inbound``
appends the reminder through ``HookDecision.modified_content``, so the
injection tests below drive that hook. The recovery-scaffolding strip still
lives in the trunk kernel's ``AgentLoop._save_turn`` and is tested against the
real bound method, as before.
