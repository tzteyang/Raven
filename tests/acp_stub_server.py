"""A minimal ACP server, run as a subprocess by ``tests/test_subagent_acp.py``.

Not a test module (pytest collects ``test_*``): this is the executable under
test's other end. It is a real child process talking real newline-delimited
JSON-RPC over stdio, so the tests exercise launch, the read loop, request
correlation and teardown rather than a mocked client.

Behaviour is chosen by ``ACP_STUB_MODE``:

- ``ok``           - full handshake, one text chunk plus a tool call, then end_turn.
- ``reject_init``  - answers ``initialize`` with a JSON-RPC error.
- ``no_session``   - handshake fine, ``session/new`` errors (an auth-shaped message).
- ``no_session_sdk`` - like ``no_session``, but refused the way both ACP SDKs wrap
                     an unhandled exception: the placeholder ``Internal error`` as
                     the message and the reason in ``data.details``.
- ``no_session_other`` - like ``no_session``, but the refusal is about anything
                     else. The handshake still advertises an auth method, which is
                     the point: an advertisement is not evidence that THIS refusal
                     was about a credential.
- ``empty_turn``   - handshake and session fine, but the prompt produces no content
                     and still reports ``stopReason: end_turn``, with the real
                     reason on stderr. This is the shape measured on a live
                     ``hermes acp`` whose provider rejected the credential.
- ``failed_call``  - like ``ok``, but the tool call answers ``status: "failed"``
                     and the turn goes on to say something after it. A run that
                     failed a call and still finished, which is the shape a
                     record could not tell from one that worked.
- ``noisy``        - like ``ok``, but writes non-JSON diagnostics to stdout and a
                     large volume to stderr before answering.
- ``flood``        - like ``ok``, but writes one stderr line past the reader's limit,
                     followed by an ordinary one, before answering.
- ``asks``         - requests something raven does not implement (``fs/read_text_file``,
                     declared unsupported in ``CLIENT_CAPABILITIES``) and, having been
                     refused, ends the turn with no content and nothing on stderr. This
                     is the shape an adapter takes when raven answers "method not found".
- ``asks_late``    - holds prompts until two are in flight, then makes that same
                     unsupported request on the *second* session only and ends both
                     turns empty. For the cross-talk case: one shared connection, two
                     sessions, and only one of them asked for anything.
- ``permission``   - asks ``session/request_permission`` with a real option list and
                     answers the prompt with the ``optionId`` raven chose, so a test can
                     assert *which* option it picked rather than only that it answered.
- ``malformed_ids`` - sends a request id and a retraction id that no dict can
  hold, while an earlier answer is still in flight.
- ``elicits_then_retracts`` - asks ``elicitation/create``, then retracts it with
  ``$/cancel_request`` and ends the turn without ever reading an answer.
- ``elicits_then_streams`` - asks ``elicitation/create`` and does not wait for an
                     answer, then streams three chunks and ends the turn. Proves a
                     handler that blocks on a human does not stall delivery on the
                     same connection.
- ``elicits_then_dies`` - asks ``elicitation/create``, then exits: the connection
                     ends while raven is still answering. For the read-loop death
                     path, where a pending answer task must not outlive the loop.
- ``elicits_and_waits`` - asks ``elicitation/create`` and holds the prompt open
                     until raven answers it, then reports what was chosen. For the
                     end-to-end path: an agent's question reaching a real human and
                     the answer coming back into the same turn.
- ``elicits_first_then_serves`` - the first session's prompt asks
                     ``elicitation/create`` and holds; every later session streams
                     and ends the turn. The two-session case of the pooled
                     connection: one session's pending question must not stall
                     another's whole round trip.
- ``no_session_delete`` - like ``ok`` but ``sessionCapabilities`` does not
                     advertise ``delete``, so a gated client must skip the call.
- ``delete_fails``   - advertises ``delete`` and answers ``session/delete`` with
                     method-not-found, for the failure-log path.
- ``asks_user_and_waits`` - notifies an ``ask_user_request`` session update and holds
                     the prompt until raven sends ``_raven/clarify_respond``, then reports
                     the answer. Raven-X's extension route, end to end: a notification out
                     and a request back, rather than one request answered by its result.
- ``asks_user_then_streams`` - notifies the same question, does not wait, and streams
                     three chunks. Notifications are dispatched inline on raven's read
                     loop, so this is what fails if answering one blocks it.
- ``two_messages`` - a preamble, the tool calls it announced, then the answer, in the
                     order measured on codex-acp. One turn, two messages, and no
                     boundary in the chunks themselves.
- ``cancelled``    - streams one chunk, then reports ``stopReason: "cancelled"``. The
                     shape measured on codex-acp when a turn is torn down part-way: a
                     reply that reads finished and is not.
- ``cancel_aware``  - holds the prompt open and answers it with
                      ``stopReason: "cancelled"`` only after a ``session/cancel``
                      notification arrives. Proves raven both sends the
                      notification and waits for the turn to settle.
- ``cancel_deaf``   - holds the prompt open and ignores ``session/cancel``
                      entirely, so the settle budget expires. Proves the timeout
                      path, which unbinds the session rather than reusing it.
- ``meta``          - answers like ``ok`` and attaches an agent-authored ``_meta``
                      table to the prompt response, the field ACP reserves for
                      it. Proves the host keeps it on the run record verbatim.
- ``silent``       - reads and never answers, for the timeout path.
- ``wedged``       - answers the first ``initialize`` and swallows everything
                     after it, pipes open, process alive: the shape where only
                     a probe round trip can tell nobody is home.
- ``mute``         - answers ``initialize``, then closes stdout and sleeps with
                     the process alive: the connection is dead, the pid is not.

Requests before ``initialize`` are refused, deliberately. A permissive stub is
what let a real bug through once already: two of the three live servers answer a
``session/new`` sent without a handshake, so the missing ``initialize`` in the
connection pool only surfaced against ``codex-acp``, which rejects it.
