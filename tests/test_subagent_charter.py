Two halves, and the second is the one that matters. A charter arrives from
another process, so the tests that count are the ones showing what it *cannot*
do: it cannot hand a tool back, it cannot replace the identity that tells a turn
where it is standing, and the Python it may carry cannot import, loop, or reach
a name outside a named handful.
