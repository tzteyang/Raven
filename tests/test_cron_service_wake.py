"""Wake-loop behavior of CronService.

The service runs one persistent loop (process due jobs, then wait for the
next claimable run or a mutation signal). Job mutations set an event instead
of cancelling a timer task, so an in-flight execution is never cancelled by
add/remove/enable/run — the double-fire + claim-leak failure mode of the old
cancel-and-rearm timer.
