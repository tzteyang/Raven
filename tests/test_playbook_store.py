"""Round-trip fidelity for the ``playbook.md`` three-region layout.

The load side parses the frontmatter region with ``yaml.safe_load``, so the save
side has to emit YAML rather than interpolate strings into it. ``description``
is model-written prose, which makes the characters YAML reserves -- a colon, a
leading ``#``, quotes, a newline -- ordinary content rather than edge cases.
Each of those produced a file that could not be read back, so each gets a case
here. CJK strings appear as unicode escapes to keep the source ASCII; they pin
that non-ASCII prose survives the trip unmangled.
