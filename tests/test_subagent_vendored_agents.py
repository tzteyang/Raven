"""Discovering the ``agents/`` product tree as agent rows (raven/agent/subagent/vendored_agents.py).

The shipped agent products are registered by scanning, not by a written list,
so what needs guarding is the scan's edges: where it looks, what it does with a
folder that is not ready, and that removing a folder removes its row. The last
one is the whole point of scanning rather than storing -- a stored row would
outlive the folder it launches.

Every test builds its own tree under ``tmp_path``. The suite's autouse
``no_discovered_products`` fixture points discovery at nothing, so these opt
back in by patching the root, which is also what keeps them independent of
which engine wheels the developer running them has installed.
