"""The two budgets a product may put on a turn: a wall clock, and a rerun.

Both are supplied as data on the turn's hook metadata rather than read from any
config the loop knows, because the loop serves every agent and must not know one
of them. So the first thing each test does is say what a product asked for, and
the last thing several of them check is that an agent asking for nothing is
bounded exactly as it was before either budget existed.

The rerun is the conditional one: a turn that produced no answer is run again
from the original question. It never salvages the failed attempt -- squeezing an
answer out of the wreckage was measured to turn a detectable zero into a
confident wrong one, and to empty this trigger while doing it.
