"""Every provider mark ships, and every tone declared on one is true of its file.

The settings page draws a brand mark per provider and per model family. The
tables live in ``ui-web/src/components/ProviderMark.tsx`` and the files live beside
them, so nothing in either language notices when the two disagree: a renamed
file leaves a row addressing a 404, and a mark no table names ships to every
user forever inside the wheel.

This is also the only gate over those tables that runs on a merge request.
GitLab's ``tests`` job runs the Python unit suite and nothing else -- the vitest
guards beside this one need an image that job does not have (see
``tests/test_ui_css_token_gate.py``), which is why the same properties are
asserted here rather than only there.

``tone`` says how a file answers the theme, and the stylesheet filters each one
differently, so a wrong tone renders as a black mark on a black ground or as a
recoloured brand:

- absent: the mark carries its own colours. Filtered not at all, which is where
  almost every vendor logo belongs.
- ``mono``: every shape is drawn in black or in ``currentColor``, which an
  ``<img>`` resolves against the SVG's own document and so renders black.
  Inverted by the dark theme.
- ``mono-white``: the same, drawn white. AMD publishes the white rendering of
  its wordmark, so the light theme is the one that lifts it.
- ``hybrid``: some shapes adapt and some carry a colour. Inverted with the hue
  rotated back, or the brand colour inverts along with the adaptive part.
