"""The gateway spine: what ``build_gateway`` wires, and what a turn meets on it.

``raven/gateway/spine.py`` assembles the Scheduler, the delivery sink and the
channel registry into the object every entrance submits turns to. These pin the
assembly (it needs a running loop), the sink's lifecycle (``on_turn_complete``,
and the error reply a ``TurnFailed`` becomes), and the route a turn takes back to
a human -- the asker and question autofill, which arm on the user origin only.
