"""Every repo path a living document cites is a path that exists.

A refactor moves a module and the prose that pointed at it goes stale in
silence: the reader follows the pointer, finds nothing, and cannot tell whether
the document or the tree is wrong. Four such pointers survived this branch --
into `raven/tracing/semconv.py`, `raven/cli/_cron_handler.py`,
`raven/memory_engine/backend.py` and a comparison doc that was deleted.

Living documents only. `docs/plans/` is a historical archive: a plan describes
the tree as it was when the plan was written, and holding it to today's layout
would make it lie about its own date.
