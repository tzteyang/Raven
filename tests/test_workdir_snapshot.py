"""``raven.agent.tools.snapshot``: what a listing of a working directory sees,
and what it refuses to see.

The listing is the only account of a file a command touched, so its blind spots
are the record's: a tree it skips is a change nobody hears about, and a tree it
walks too far is a run reporting thousands of files it did not author.
