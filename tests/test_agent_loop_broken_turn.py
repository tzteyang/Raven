"""A turn that dies still leaves its work in the session.

``_save_turn`` only ran on the happy path, so a cancelled or crashed turn lost
everything back to the question that started it -- the reader watched a page of
streamed work vanish on the next reload. These tests drive the real
``_process_message`` path with providers that die at chosen points and assert
what the JSONL keeps: the tail of the turn, a synthetic result for any tool
call left open, and one closing marker that says why the transcript stops.
