"""SubagentManager concurrency gate.

Isolates the gate: build_executor and _run_subagent_inner are stubbed, so the
test drives only the Semaphore in _run_subagent (no real VM, no real LLM). A
stubbed inner holds each subagent inside the gate on an Event, letting the test
observe the concurrent peak.

Also covers: a subagent reuses the main LiteLLMProvider instance verbatim
(SubagentManager.provider), so the api_key that instance was constructed
with reaches acompletion on the subagent's own chat_with_retry() calls too —
acompletion is mocked, so this stays "no real LLM".
