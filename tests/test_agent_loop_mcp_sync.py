"""The seam between a real ``AgentLoop`` and the MCP connection manager.

These use a real loop instance, not a fake one. The whole ``plug.*`` surface
calls ``loop.apply_mcp_config`` / ``loop.mcp_manager`` / ``loop.mcp_executor_provider``, and a
test that stands those up itself proves nothing about whether the loop has them
