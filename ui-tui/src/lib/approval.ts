// Approval is narrower than a generic prompt: the user grants this request --
// once, for this session, or as a prefix rule the runtime suggested and they
// may edit -- or refuses it. The runtime is what remembers or writes; this
// module only carries the choice, so no UI call site can mint authority of its
// own. Deny continues the turn (the model reads the refusal and goes another
// way); deny_stop is the one choice that ends it.
// Labels are keys, not text: the locale can change under a running TUI (`/lang`),
// and a literal captured in this module would keep the language it was written
// in. The English text stays beside its key as the fallback the renderer passes
// to `t`, so this list still reads as the three choices it offers.
