// Bridges `RpcClient.subscribe<TurnEvent>('turn.subscribe', ...)` notifications
// onto the existing `turnController` so UI state updates without going through
// the legacy `GatewayClientCompat.gw.on('event', ...)` adapter. The factory
// returns a thin handle with `attach / detach / send / cancel / isTurnActive`
// so it can be unit-tested against a fake RpcClient (no socket required) and
// wired into `useMainApp.ts` as a per-session lifecycle object.
//
// This file does NOT replace the legacy event handler in
// `createGatewayEventHandler.ts` — that path stays alive for the 169 existing
// .tsx consumers per the adapter-retirement plan.
// Once the Python `turn.*` handlers land and `prompt.submit` is removed, the
// legacy chat-event branch in createGatewayEventHandler becomes dead code
// and is deleted alongside the gateway-compat shim.
