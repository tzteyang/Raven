// Live Agents Strip: what the session has delegated, under the status rule,
// top to bottom: the `Raven` way-back row, the hand-made instances, the loose
// spawns, then the graphs -- whole and last. The instance rows -- one per
// addressable instance while resumable, running or idle -- are the job the
// chips row above the composer used to do: clicking one switches Direct Chat
// to it, the `Raven` row leading the strip is the way back to the main
// conversation, and the row the user is on carries a gutter bar -- the same
// fact the composer's top border states at the point of typing, said here
// against the list so the name up there can be read back to a row.
//
// A graph line per `run_subagent_dag` run carries that run's tally and stays
// after the run is over, so a finished fan-out leaves something behind; under each, an agent line per running or queued node, then
// the instances the graph fanned out -- kept indented there after the run, the
// header rebuilt from the rows themselves after a resume. The loose spawns
// leave as each one settles.
//
// Clicking a non-instance agent line opens the Agents Overlay straight into
// that run's detail, where its transcript streams as it works; clicking a graph
// line opens the overlay itself, since a graph is not one transcript.
// `RAVEN_TUI_AGENT_STRIP_LINGER_MS` keeps settled agent lines on the strip for
// that long, which is a testing knob rather than a preference: the line is the
// only way into a run's detail, so a run that ends is one that can no longer be
// opened, and watching that boundary needs the line to stay put.
