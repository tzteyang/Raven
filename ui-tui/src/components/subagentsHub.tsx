 * Row-flattening and offset computation, pulled out as a pure function so the
 * concatenation order and the index-to-row mapping are unit-testable without
 * rendering anything or sending a keystroke. `flat` is what `idx` indexes
 * into; `installedCount`/`uninstalledCount`/`presetsCount` are the section
 * sizes in `flat`'s order (installed, then not-installed, then presets),
 * which both the selection math and the section headers key off.
 *
 * `uninstalled` is keyed on `group` rather than on whether an entry was saved:
 * a row whose launch command is not on PATH belongs there whether or not it was
 * configured, because nothing can make it run from this overlay and offering it
 * under presets only invites a failed add. It holds both of the kinds that have
 * a command to find -- `cli` and `acp`.
 *
 * A `builtin` row is raven's own in-process agent. It is `configured: false`
 * (not writing a row is how "use the package's default" is spelled) and it is
 * never probed, so both of the predicates below would misfile it -- the first
 * into "not installed", which is the opposite of true for a loop running in this
 * very process. It is placed under `installed` on its kind alone.
 *
 * An `openai` row never lands there, no matter what `group` says. The backend
 * derives its group from whether an api key is set (see `_group`), so "not
 * installed" for that kind means "no key yet" -- and the key is typed into the
 * add/edit form reached from these very sections. Filing it as unavailable
 * would hide the one control that fixes it. So an openai row is placed on
 * `configured` alone: saved ones under `installed`, the rest under `presets`,
 * where a keyless preset is in fact addable. `probe_detail` on the row still
 * reports the missing key, so the state stays visible either way.
 *
 * Stated as one predicate so the three sections are visibly exhaustive and
 * disjoint: `uninstalled` is its exact complement, and `installed`/`presets`
 * split the rest on `configured`. No row can fall out of every section.

 *  add/remove does not visibly regress every row to unknown -- only the
 *  columns that a real probe (initial load or the `r` key) last set are
 *  shown, everything else (enabled, test_running, last_test_*, ...) comes
 *  from the fresh response.
 *
 *  `group` needs the same treatment, for every kind whose group the backend
 *  derives from `probe_status` -- which is every kind it does not derive some
 *  other way. `probe: false` legitimately reports all of those as
 *  `uninstalled`, and carrying the prior group forward keeps an installed
 *  agent from visibly relocating to NOT INSTALLED on every mutation. The two
 *  exceptions take the fresh value because it is never stale: an `openai`
 *  row's group comes from whether a key is set, so carrying it forward would
 *  keep the row reading uninstalled right after the user pastes a key, and a
 *  `builtin` row's group is a constant. Keyed on that split rather than on
 *  the probe-derived kinds by name, so a kind added to `_group`'s fallthrough
 *  branch is covered here the day it lands -- naming them is what let `acp`
 *  relocate three configured agents on every toggle.
 *
 *  `renamed` covers `subagents.update` with a `new_name`: the fresh row is
