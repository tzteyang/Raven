# Raven one-line installer (macOS / Linux).
#
#   Remote (website):   curl -fsSL https://raven.evermind.ai/install.sh | sh
#   Local (dev clone):  git clone ... && cd raven && ./install.sh
#
# A piped run always installs the published release wheel, even from inside a
# clone. Set RAVEN_LOCAL_SRC=<dir> to force an editable install of a checkout.
# Set RAVEN_MINIMAL=1 to skip the chromium download and the LibreOffice offer;
# the wheel install itself is unchanged. Set RAVEN_NO_LAUNCH=1 to skip the
# closing `raven web` (CI, Dockerfiles), so the script returns.
#
# Goal: a clean machine ends up able to run `raven` / `raven tui` from any
# directory with no manual steps. The script is idempotent -- it detects what
# is already present and only fills the gaps:
#   1. uv            (Python toolchain + package manager)
#   2. Node.js >= 22 (TUI runtime; installed privately if the system lacks it)
#   3. raven         (installed as a global uv tool -> ~/.local/bin/raven)
#   4. chromium      (browser-tool runtime; downloaded by playwright)
#   5. LibreOffice   (deck preview; installed on macOS, offered on Linux)
#
# It then ends in the product: `raven web` opens the page in a browser and holds
# this terminal, so the install finishes on something running rather than on a
# hint to go and start it.
#
# Probe rule: this script is served from main and installs the latest release,
# which can predate a subcommand main already knows about. Every `raven <sub>`
# call below is preceded by `raven <sub> --help`; when the probe fails, the
# script finishes on the one command every release has.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose (runs under dash/ash, not just bash).
