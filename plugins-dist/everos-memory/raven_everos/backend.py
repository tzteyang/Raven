"""EverosBackend — HTTP-only memory backend.

The backend is the host's :class:`MemoryBackend` implementation,
delegating to a running EverOS server over HTTP
(``POST /api/v2/memory/{search,add,...}``).

Constructor accepts an explicit ``adapter`` so tests can inject a
fake without monkeypatching module-level imports. Production wiring
goes through :func:`make_backend` -> ``EverosBackend(ctx)`` ->
``_make_http_adapter``.

Three architectural invariants worth re-stating:

1. **No compaction.** ``backend.store`` writes to EverOS's index and
   returns. raven core's ``MemoryConsolidator.maybe_consolidate`` is
   a separate post-turn step the host owns.
2. **No ``long_term`` property.** raven core's :class:`MemoryStore`
   stays where it is; Sentinel / Personalizer / ContextBuilder import
   it directly. The backend is unaware of MEMORY.md.
3. **recall names the track explicitly.** EverOS takes
   ``owner_type: Literal["user", "agent"]`` explicitly; the host passes
   ``user_id`` XOR ``agent_id`` and the backend forwards the set field
   straight to EverOS's :class:`SearchRequest`. Neither or both set
   logs a warning and recall returns ``[]``.
