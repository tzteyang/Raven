"""Read what a running EverOS server can actually do.

``server._probe_health`` answers "is the process up". From everos 1.2.1
``/health`` also reports which capabilities the server managed to *build*, and
those are different questions: 1.2.1 boots with ``[llm]`` alone rather than
aborting, so a server whose embedding provider is misconfigured still answers
200 and quietly degrades to keyword-only search. A caller that stops at
"reachable" therefore reports a healthy install that cannot recall anything.

This module only reports what the server says. Deciding whether that contradicts
what the user configured belongs to the caller, which is the side that can read
``everos.toml``.
