    the memory backend read ``plugins.config`` and used whatever address was

    reported to the user as a startup timeout blaming a missing install. A default

    ``timeout`` is a budget for how long a caller is willing to make the user

    most one session and heals itself, while a large one blocks every first
    session of a machine's uptime. Measured cold start on a small store is
    around two seconds.

    ``on_proc`` receives the spawned child the moment it exists, so a caller
    still holds it when this function goes on to raise.

    ``on_wait`` fires once, only when an actual boot is about to be waited on --
    never when a server is already answering. That lets a caller narrate the
