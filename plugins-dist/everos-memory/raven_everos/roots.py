"""Find the EverOS roots on this machine and say what state each is in.

A root can already be served on another port, by a process this module has to
notice rather than talk over: assuming one root at one address, and starting a
server whenever that address does not answer, costs a user their memory.

Ownership is deliberately not one of the questions. Only roots raven creates for
itself are scanned, and whether raven may write to the one it picks is settled by
the lane the user chose in the wizard -- a directory that happens to exist cannot
answer that.

Discovery answers four questions per candidate root, and deliberately keeps them
apart because they fail independently:

``configured``
    Does ``[llm]`` carry a model and a key? Without it no server can finish
    starting, so an unconfigured root is a half-built one, not a broken one.
``declared_url``
    What address does ``<root>/everos.toml`` say a server for this root listens
    on? The root is self-describing; this is the authority.
``alive``
    Does that address answer ``/health``?
``lock_held``
    Is the OME jobstore lock taken? That lock is per data directory, not per
    port, so it is the only reliable answer to "is something already serving
    this data". A root can be locked while its declared address is silent --
    that is what a server started on a different port looks like.

Nothing here writes, signals, or starts anything.
