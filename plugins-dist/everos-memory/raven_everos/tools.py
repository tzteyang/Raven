"""``understand_media`` — EverOS's multimodal understanding, as an agent tool.

Contributed via the manifest's ``[[plugin.contributes.tools]]`` slot and
registered into the agent's tool set at boot. The LLM calls it on demand to
read the contents of an attachment it can't natively consume — a PDF, an
audio clip, an Office doc, a scanned image — instead of Raven parsing
every attachment up front. The attachment paths are surfaced to the model in
the user message (see ``render.build_user_content``); the model passes them
back here.

The tool is deliberately thin: all parsing lives in
:func:`raven_everos.multimodal.understand_files`, which reuses the exact
parser EverOS runs during memory ingest.
