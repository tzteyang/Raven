"""The design turn frame: domain selection in, task-state projection through.

The fork ran the Visual Domain Selector inside context assembly -- a fork-only
parameter on its SkillsSegmentBuilder, gathered in parallel with general skill
routing -- and projected the resident Task State onto a transient copy of the
transcript before every model call (fork ``agent/loop/main.py:1184-1230``).
Here both ride the loop's own hook phases, per the amended verdict:

* ``before_user_inbound`` -- repoint the turn to its session's directory under
  ``<workdir>/designs/``, then run one selection over the fixed domain catalog
  and append the card block below a separator to the model's view of the
  inbound text. The session record keeps the user's own words on every turn
  outcome: the loop persists ``inbound_original`` on the healthy save and --
  sealed at the engine wave's kernel repair -- on the cancelled/failed save too
  (``_save_broken_turn`` used to drop it, which let a hook's rewrite land in
  history on exactly the outcomes users hit mid-task). So the block reaches
  neither the transcript on disk nor the memory extractor -- the D1
  structural guarantee, pinned by the plugin family's parameterized history
  tests, one per exit door. The four D1 rebuild clauses
  are landed here as code: (1) the rewritten inbound reaches every downstream
  consumer (personalizer, model router, general skill routing, the assembly /
  scent / memory-recall query, ``turn_question``), so the block stays cards-
  only, never bodies, below a ``---`` separator; (2) a command-shaped or
  blank inbound is never rewritten -- hooks fire before slash dispatch;
  (3) the seat assumes pull discovery: the shipped product config never sets
  ``skillForge.discovery``, and switching the host to push would inject the
  general lane's full bodies beside these cards (the double-injection trap
  the verdict forbids); (4) the selection call rides ``active_binding()``
  first -- the fork's own binding order -- so a session ``/model`` switch
  reaches it.

  One selection is one LLM call embedding all fifteen full SKILL.md bodies:
  2,721 lines / 246,422 bytes measured, roughly 60-90k input tokens at CJK
  tokenizer rates (C7). The catalog is constant -- a caching provider pays
  it once per prefix -- and ``visualDomainSelector.enabled`` is the off
  switch. Selection failure degrades to the full description catalog for the
  turn (the fork's shape), never to a broken turn.

* ``before_iteration`` -- repoint turns that skipped the inbound phase, then
  project the current Task State as an ``append_note`` before every model call.
  State is keyed by the bound working directory, shared with the tool seat.
  Each session uses its own directory by default, isolating both its resident
  list and its relative file paths. The fork
  stripped stale projections from a transient copy; a note appended here
  stays where it landed in the transcript, so an older projection can also
  be eaten by a mid-turn compaction -- both are the ledgered D5 loss, and
  both self-heal because every iteration appends the fresh snapshot.

* ``after_send`` -- three reply tails: the fork's own two first, in its own
  order -- the completion notice while unfinished items remain (fork
  ``main.py:2928-2931``), then the caller-workspace git summary the fork
  launcher appended after every answer (fork ``run.py:357-378``, the amended
  D3 rebuild), names and counts rather than a patch, and only when the bound
  working directory is a git tree, a workspace that is not a checkout passing
  untouched -- and last the session directory this turn worked in, absolute
  and machine-written. That third one is the caller's handoff: the directory
  above is the one the caller dispatched into, and this turn's files are not
  in it, so the engine names the directory they are in on the same reply that
  names them. The rewritten reply is what ``context_engine.after_turn``
  receives, so Curator bookkeeping sees the appended tails (bounded, replaced
  each turn; the ppt after_send rides the same channel) -- the session record
  and the memory store do not.
